# printing output by using python just need a simple code or we can say simple syntax
# printing output depends on datatype : 1. int or 2. string
# 1. code to print a int datatype value is as follows :-
print 2                             #output will be 2
# 2. code to print a string value is as follows :-
print "Hello!"                      # it need to be in double quotes and output is Hello!
