# Basic Python Syntax
## Python 2

- Printing output in **Python 2** :-  
   `print "argument that you want to print"`     
      OR   
   `print 'argument that you want to print'`

- Mathematical operators :-  
   >`x = 8`  
   >`y = 4`  
   >`print x + y`                     # it will give output of sum of x and y  
   >`print x - y`                     # it will give difference of x and y  
   >`print x / y`                     # it will give quotient when x is divided by y  
   >`print x % y`                     # it is modulo function and gives remainder when x is divied by y  
   >`print x ** y`                    # it means x^y. it is way to represent power operator  
   
 - Single line comments can be given by putting **#** before a line
 
 - Multi line comments can be given by putting 3 double quotes before and after the lines.
 
    example of putting multiline comments is :   
    **""" hello   
    how are you """**
 
 - To validate a variable to be an integer or a string, use `isinstance(<var>, <type>)`   
   it accepts two parameter:
   - variable name
   - Type to be validated
     
    example: isinstance(a, dict) , isinstance(num, integer)   
    It returns True if true else False.
