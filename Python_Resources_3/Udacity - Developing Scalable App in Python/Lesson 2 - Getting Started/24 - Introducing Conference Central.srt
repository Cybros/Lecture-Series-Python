0:00:00.370,0:00:02.740
Alright. Let's have something more concrete to work

0:00:02.740,0:00:07.230
on. If you've organized events, you've probably used sites

0:00:07.230,0:00:10.530
like [UNKNOWN] or eventbrite.com. Well, let's say you wanted

0:00:10.530,0:00:13.670
to create an app to organize conferences. That type

0:00:13.670,0:00:15.720
of application would need to support at least the

0:00:15.720,0:00:18.790
following. A user can register, a user can create

0:00:18.790,0:00:22.660
conferences. Users can attend conferences. And of course, it

0:00:22.660,0:00:25.720
needs to be accessible both from the browser and

0:00:25.720,0:00:28.425
the mobile device. Well, we're going to create such an

0:00:28.425,0:00:31.480
application. And it's going to be called Conference Central. And

0:00:31.480,0:00:33.800
you're tasked to build it. And since it needs

0:00:33.800,0:00:37.550
to support multiple backends, you will use Cloud Endpoints to

0:00:37.550,0:00:41.100
create this application. Let's get started with Conference Central,

0:00:41.100,0:00:45.130
by having you download the skeleton code. Now, let's

0:00:45.130,0:00:47.600
take a quick tour of the completed Conference Central

0:00:47.600,0:00:50.700
application that you will build. But before we do that,

0:00:50.700,0:00:53.710
let's do a quick demo of the finished application. As

0:00:53.710,0:00:56.330
you can see, you're presented with a very nice landing

0:00:56.330,0:00:59.200
page for Conference Central. And if we scroll down, you

0:00:59.200,0:01:02.730
can see options to view conferences. Create conferences and update your

0:01:02.730,0:01:06.990
profile. But, before that, let's sign into the application. Sign

0:01:06.990,0:01:09.910
in, we'll use Google Plus sign in. Once we are signed

0:01:09.910,0:01:13.230
into the application, we can start to explore the functionality.

0:01:13.230,0:01:15.970
I can, for example, go to my profile where my personal

0:01:15.970,0:01:19.640
information is stored. I can also show the registered

0:01:19.640,0:01:22.870
conferences. So here you can see the name of the

0:01:22.870,0:01:25.090
conference. The city where it will be in. The

0:01:25.090,0:01:28.950
start date, organizer, how many people are registered to conference.

0:01:28.950,0:01:31.650
And how many tickets are available to the conference.

0:01:31.650,0:01:34.970
You can also query for different conferences. For example, the

0:01:34.970,0:01:37.100
ones you've created. Or the ones that you will

0:01:37.100,0:01:41.120
attend. You can also query by other types of properties.

0:01:41.120,0:01:44.650
And you can view the details for a conference. You can also of

0:01:44.650,0:01:47.329
course, create new conferences. Well that's an

0:01:47.329,0:01:50.030
overview of Conference Central. The application that

0:01:50.030,0:01:53.660
you will build and run in the Google Cloud. Now it's time for

0:01:53.660,0:01:58.290
you to do some work and get you started building Conference Central. Good luck.
