Now, it's time to setup your Development[br]Environment, which is to say,

0:00:03.252,0:00:05.010
The Tools You'll Need for this course.

0:00:05.010,0:00:08.220
There are four things you'll need to[br]use Google App Engine with Python.

0:00:08.220,0:00:09.850
First, you'll need a text editor.

0:00:09.850,0:00:12.419
Anything with syntax highlighting[br]will work just fine.

0:00:12.419,0:00:14.562
You can use whatever you're[br]comfortable with, but

0:00:14.562,0:00:16.861
I'll use sublime text when[br]showing you code examples.

0:00:16.861,0:00:20.665
Second, you'll need a working[br]installation of Python 2.7,

0:00:20.665,0:00:22.126
Python 3 will not work.

0:00:22.126,0:00:24.773
To check which version[br]of Python you have,

0:00:24.773,0:00:29.270
just run Python dash dash version or[br]Python dash big V from the terminal.

0:00:29.270,0:00:30.531
You'll need git.

0:00:30.531,0:00:34.013
Version control in general is a must[br]have for any project, but we're hosting

0:00:34.013,0:00:37.512
the project files on GitHub, so it's[br]pretty much the right tool for the job.

0:00:37.512,0:00:41.555
And you'll also need the Google App[br]Engine Software Development Kit or SDK.

0:00:41.555,0:00:44.890
You can download the SDK from[br]the URL in the Instructor Notes.

0:00:44.890,0:00:45.886
For Windows and Mac,

0:00:45.886,0:00:48.718
it will come with a nice GUI[br]tool called App Engine Launcher.

0:00:48.718,0:00:50.011
If you're running Linux,

0:00:50.011,0:00:53.399
you'll use command line tools[br]devappserver.py and appconfig.py.

0:00:53.399,0:00:56.595
There's a link in the Instruction Notes[br]with more details on those.

0:00:56.595,0:00:59.964
Another option is the Google Cloud[br]command line tool, G Cloud.

0:00:59.964,0:01:03.835
This includes tools for App Engine as[br]well as other Google Cloud services.

0:01:03.835,0:01:06.578
However, G Cloud is a bit harder[br]to setup for basic purposes.

0:01:06.578,0:01:09.259
So, I'll be using the basic SDK and[br]App Engine Launcher for

0:01:09.259,0:01:11.140
the examples you'll see in this course.

0:01:11.140,0:01:13.821
Now go ahead and make sure your[br]system is setup for development.

0:01:13.821,0:01:16.680
Check off the steps you've completed and[br]continue when you're done.
