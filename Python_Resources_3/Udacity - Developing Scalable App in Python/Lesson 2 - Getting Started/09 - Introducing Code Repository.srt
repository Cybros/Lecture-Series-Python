Now let's take a look around[br]the code repository for this course.

0:00:03.337,0:00:04.752
We have provided some examples and

0:00:04.752,0:00:06.907
scaffolding for[br]the main app you'll be working on.

0:00:06.907,0:00:10.462
Follow the link in the Instruction Notes[br]to get the course code repository

0:00:10.462,0:00:11.046
on GitHub.

0:00:11.046,0:00:15.127
From there, you can choose either[br]to clone the repository or

0:00:15.127,0:00:17.218
just download it as a zip file.

0:00:17.218,0:00:19.620
You can see that there are folders for[br]each of the lessons.

0:00:19.620,0:00:22.656
We'll provide you with the starting[br]code for all of the exercises.

0:00:22.656,0:00:26.215
All the exercises build on the previous[br]ones, so you can start with the first

0:00:26.215,0:00:29.397
one and continue working on your[br]version until the end of the class.

0:00:29.397,0:00:32.049
Or you can grab the starting code for[br]a particular exercise and

0:00:32.049,0:00:33.020
continue from there.
