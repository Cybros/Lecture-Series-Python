0:00:00.250,0:00:03.440
You now have an understanding of how[br]endpoints simplifies dealing with

0:00:03.440,0:00:04.280
authentication.

0:00:04.280,0:00:07.120
There are a couple things you have to[br]do to make sure authentication works,

0:00:07.120,0:00:11.080
not only in your development environment[br]on local host, but also on F-spot.

0:00:11.080,0:00:13.900
To do both of these,[br]you'll go to your developers console at

0:00:13.900,0:00:18.645
console.developers.google.com/project[br]and select your project name.

0:00:18.645,0:00:21.395
The first thing you'll need to do[br]is to configure your App's user

0:00:21.395,0:00:24.185
consent screen.a Google won't[br]tell your app anything about

0:00:24.185,0:00:25.955
the user without the user's consent.

0:00:25.955,0:00:29.447
So, the user will have to accept this[br]consent screen before the app can work.

0:00:29.447,0:00:31.487
This screen will display[br]your app's name and

0:00:31.487,0:00:33.437
give the user a chance[br]to know what's going on.

0:00:33.437,0:00:37.327
So, go to APIs & auth,[br]and then Consent screen.

0:00:37.327,0:00:40.627
Select an email address that you[br]want to associate with the app.

0:00:40.627,0:00:41.727
And, put in a product name.

0:00:41.727,0:00:44.587
And, that will be displayed over[br]on the user consent screen when

0:00:44.587,0:00:45.970
the user logs in.

0:00:45.970,0:00:48.810
Second, you need to make sure that your[br]app's front end will be allowed to

0:00:48.810,0:00:49.930
access the backend.

0:00:49.930,0:00:53.320
To do this, under API and[br]auth, go to Credentials.

0:00:53.320,0:00:56.630
In the Auth section say,[br]Create New Client ID.

0:00:56.630,0:01:00.660
Then, pick Web application, and[br]under Authorized JavaScript Origins,

0:01:00.660,0:01:03.540
change the URL field[br]to contain two URL's.

0:01:03.540,0:01:07.930
One for the https URL of your appspot[br]app, and one for your local host,

0:01:07.930,0:01:10.310
including the correct[br]port your server runs.

0:01:10.310,0:01:13.390
Bearing in mind, if it's the second[br]app you have running on local host,

0:01:13.390,0:01:17.250
because you still have the hello app[br]running, it'll be 9080 instead of 8080.

0:01:17.250,0:01:19.620
Now, copy this client ID value.

0:01:19.620,0:01:24.190
Yes, this big long noisy string[br]that ends in googleusercontent.com.

0:01:24.190,0:01:26.420
And open up settings.py.

0:01:26.420,0:01:28.760
And, put it here under Web_Client_ID.

0:01:28.760,0:01:31.670
In the next exercise, you'll get some[br]practice adding functionality to

0:01:31.670,0:01:32.960
the Conference Central app.

0:01:32.960,0:01:36.490
Previously, we used dummy data in[br]the get profile from user function.

0:01:36.490,0:01:39.370
Instead, you'll now be able to get[br]the data from the logged in user, and

0:01:39.370,0:01:40.340
create a profile for them.
