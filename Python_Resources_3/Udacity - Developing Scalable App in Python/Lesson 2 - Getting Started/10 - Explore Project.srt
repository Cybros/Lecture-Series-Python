0:00:00.167,0:00:03.719
Now your development environment is[br]set up and you have the starting code.

0:00:03.719,0:00:06.854
I'll walk you through a very[br]simple Endpoints API project.

0:00:06.854,0:00:13.330
You can find the code in the Lesson_2[br]folder named 000_Hello_Endpoints.

0:00:13.330,0:00:15.772
Add that whole folder[br]to your code editor.

0:00:15.772,0:00:19.484
The app.yaml file is where[br]the configuration of the app is stored.

0:00:19.484,0:00:22.822
There are important configuration[br]parameters that go here,

0:00:22.822,0:00:25.846
like your project ID and[br]the version number of your app.

0:00:25.846,0:00:28.038
Project ID needed when[br]you deploy your app and

0:00:28.038,0:00:31.279
you can have several versions of[br]your app running at the same time.

0:00:31.279,0:00:33.014
Down here there's configuration for

0:00:33.014,0:00:35.946
URL handlers that determine what[br]should be done with a request.

0:00:35.946,0:00:39.314
You can configure static file paths,[br]and for Endpoints,

0:00:39.314,0:00:43.330
what to do with when an Endpoint[br]request is performed.

0:00:43.330,0:00:46.950
As you can see, there's a secure[br]always line for the handlers.

0:00:46.950,0:00:48.660
That means the connection[br]between the client and

0:00:48.660,0:00:51.400
the server will always be over HTTPS.

0:00:51.400,0:00:53.400
Even if the client initially[br]tried to use HTTP.

0:00:54.400,0:00:57.110
And at the end,[br]you'll see the library's configuration.

0:00:57.110,0:01:00.460
For this simple app, you just need[br]to include the Endpoints library.

0:01:00.460,0:01:04.647
So, back up in the handlers,[br]you'll see there's an entry for

0:01:04.647,0:01:07.657
slash that points to static/index.html.

0:01:07.657,0:01:10.974
But what's much more[br]interesting is this handler for

0:01:10.974,0:01:14.739
Endpoints that points to[br]helloworld_api.APPLICATION.

0:01:14.739,0:01:17.964
And there's this file called[br]helloworld_api.py, and

0:01:17.964,0:01:22.320
this is where the application code lives[br]and where the endpoints are defined.
