0:00:00.170,0:00:03.100
But look down here into[br]this safe profile method.

0:00:03.100,0:00:06.230
This is supposed to save a profile[br]that the user has submitted and

0:00:06.230,0:00:07.910
return the updated profile.

0:00:07.910,0:00:12.390
But right now all it does is well,[br]very same thing as get profile.

0:00:12.390,0:00:15.265
Now what this should do[br]is take display name and

0:00:15.265,0:00:19.260
t-shirt size from a post request and[br]update the output accordingly.

0:00:19.260,0:00:21.010
It's not going to save anything yet, but

0:00:21.010,0:00:23.340
it should return the same[br]thing that it's given.

0:00:23.340,0:00:25.530
And that's your job in the first[br]programming exercise for

0:00:25.530,0:00:27.000
this conference central app.

0:00:27.000,0:00:30.396
You should modify the save profile[br]function to use the appropriate

0:00:30.396,0:00:33.800
messages.message class from models.py,[br]and

0:00:33.800,0:00:38.130
pick the one that can send two fields,[br]displayName and teeShirtSize.

0:00:38.130,0:00:40.750
Then for the method to be able[br]to return the changed values,

0:00:40.750,0:00:44.000
you'll have to pass that request[br]up to the doProfile function.

0:00:44.000,0:00:47.490
Complete the steps outlined in TODO[br]1 and deploy the app locally and

0:00:47.490,0:00:50.760
test by changing display name and[br]t-shirt size in the request.

0:00:50.760,0:00:53.220
You should see the changed[br]values in the response.

0:00:53.220,0:00:55.810
Once you're done,[br]check off the completed steps and

0:00:55.810,0:00:57.150
enter your appspot project ID.
