0:00:00.170,0:00:03.460
Your app is now in the state that[br]the saveProfile method knows

0:00:03.460,0:00:06.680
that when it is called, it should be[br]passed data that conforms to the fields

0:00:06.680,0:00:09.160
defined ProfileMiniForm class.

0:00:09.160,0:00:12.735
Which in practical terms means that the[br]input data can include display name and

0:00:12.735,0:00:13.880
teeShirtSize.

0:00:13.880,0:00:17.040
If the input data includes any[br]other fields, they will be ignored.

0:00:17.040,0:00:19.560
Since we also want to store[br]the user's email address,

0:00:19.560,0:00:22.480
we'll do that by getting the email[br]address of the logged in user.

0:00:22.480,0:00:24.960
This of course means that[br]the user must be logged in.

0:00:24.960,0:00:28.380
You can check that by calling[br]endpoints.get_current_user.

0:00:28.380,0:00:31.600
If that does not return to user object,[br]the user is not logged in.

0:00:31.600,0:00:34.600
The endpoints system lets your[br]code handle this case by raising

0:00:34.600,0:00:37.890
an exception, which the front end[br]can handle by displaying an error or

0:00:37.890,0:00:39.820
redirecting to the log in screen.

0:00:39.820,0:00:43.020
So you don't have to change the[br]saveProfile method to get this behavior.

0:00:43.020,0:00:46.110
But instead work with[br]the getProfileFromUser method

0:00:46.110,0:00:48.020
where we used dummy data before.

0:00:48.020,0:00:50.540
Check out the TODO 2 comments.

0:00:50.540,0:00:53.120
Step 1,[br]make sure the user is authenticated.

0:00:53.120,0:00:57.540
If they're not, then we'll raise[br]the endpoints.UnauthorizedException.

0:00:57.540,0:01:00.730
Step 2, use the real data[br]from the logged in user

0:01:00.730,0:01:04.640
instead of the dummy data for[br]displayName and mainEmail.

0:01:04.640,0:01:06.610
Now there's one more thing to[br]change if you'd like to use

0:01:06.610,0:01:11.140
the app from the JavaScript based front[br]end, as well as from the APIs Explorer.

0:01:11.140,0:01:15.260
Take the same WEB_CLIENT_ID that[br]you used in settings.py and

0:01:15.260,0:01:21.690
put it in the JavaScript file app.js,[br]in place of this web-client-id here.

0:01:21.690,0:01:23.890
When you're done,[br]deploy your code on localhost and

0:01:23.890,0:01:25.690
test it, then deploy to appspot.

0:01:25.690,0:01:28.620
Check off each one of these boxes[br]as you finish that step and

0:01:28.620,0:01:30.250
then fill in your project ID down here.
