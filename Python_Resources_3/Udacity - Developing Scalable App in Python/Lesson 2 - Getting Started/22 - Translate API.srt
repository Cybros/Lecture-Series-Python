0:00:00.190,0:00:02.760
So you've seen that[br]the APIs Explorer lets you try out

0:00:02.760,0:00:05.670
the API that your application[br]exposes through endpoints.

0:00:05.670,0:00:09.380
Google uses the APIs Explorer in the[br]same way to let you investigate the APIs

0:00:09.380,0:00:12.540
that are publicly available for[br]the services that it provides.

0:00:12.540,0:00:15.117
For example, let's consider[br]Google's translation service.

0:00:15.117,0:00:18.823
You can go to tranlate.google.com[br]to translate some text from one

0:00:18.823,0:00:20.063
language to another.

0:00:20.063,0:00:23.690
However, you could also write[br]applications that do translations using

0:00:23.690,0:00:24.707
the Translate API.

0:00:24.707,0:00:28.236
And you can try out the Translate API[br]using the APIs Explorer.

0:00:28.236,0:00:31.730
It's easy to find the APIs Explorer for[br]Google's public APIs.

0:00:31.730,0:00:32.380
Just search for it.

0:00:32.380,0:00:35.563
When you go to the APIs Explorer,[br]you'll see a list of all of

0:00:35.563,0:00:38.440
the APIs that Google provides for[br]developers to use.

0:00:38.440,0:00:42.224
Search or scroll down to[br]the Translate API and click on that.

0:00:42.224,0:00:45.475
You'll see the functions of the[br]Translate API exposes through endpoints.

0:00:45.475,0:00:47.475
These are functions that you,[br]as a developer,

0:00:47.475,0:00:49.200
can use in your own application.

0:00:49.200,0:00:50.330
Now a task for you.

0:00:50.330,0:00:51.720
Go to the APIs Explorer for

0:00:51.720,0:00:55.640
the translation service to find out the[br]meaning in English of the name Gundega,

0:00:55.640,0:00:58.240
the name of the instructional[br]designer for this course.

0:00:58.240,0:01:02.260
Using the Translate API, find[br]the language.translations.list function.

0:01:02.260,0:01:04.099
Use a target language of en and

0:01:04.099,0:01:06.930
then try to find out what[br]Gundega means in English.

0:01:06.930,0:01:10.610
Then from the returned message, find out[br]what the detected source language was.
