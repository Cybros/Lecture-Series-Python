0:00:00.300,0:00:02.440
The first question you'll probably ask yourself at this

0:00:02.440,0:00:04.890
point. How do I access App Engine in the

0:00:04.890,0:00:07.490
first place? Well that is a pretty important question

0:00:07.490,0:00:09.760
to answer. And we're happy to tell you that it's

0:00:09.760,0:00:13.720
super easy. So first of all, here you are.

0:00:13.720,0:00:17.190
A star developer. And you should already have a

0:00:17.190,0:00:21.410
Google account, that you probably use for many different

0:00:21.410,0:00:25.390
Google services. Such as Gmail, YouTube, Google Plus, et cetera.

0:00:26.440,0:00:29.690
Well, guess what? Your standard Google account also allows you

0:00:29.690,0:00:32.540
to create app engine applications that run on the Google

0:00:32.540,0:00:36.090
cloud platform. So there is no additional account required. What

0:00:36.090,0:00:38.590
you do is simply log on to the developers console

0:00:38.590,0:00:41.450
that we will go through later. And register the App

0:00:41.450,0:00:45.120
Engine applications you want to create. And once you've done

0:00:45.120,0:00:48.050
that, the time has come for you to create those

0:00:48.050,0:00:51.170
great cloud applications. So you need to sit down, and

0:00:51.170,0:00:54.190
hack, and hack. And hack, and hack until you

0:00:54.190,0:00:57.070
have something awesome that you want to test. And then

0:00:57.070,0:00:59.310
you can fire up an instance of App Engine, which

0:00:59.310,0:01:02.690
runs on your local development machine. And that is of

0:01:02.690,0:01:05.620
course, great. Since it allows you to use all your

0:01:05.620,0:01:09.150
standard tools. Such as debuggers and providers to get those

0:01:09.150,0:01:12.740
bugs out. And once you've done that, it's time to

0:01:12.740,0:01:16.340
run your applications on computers in the Google data centers.

0:01:16.340,0:01:17.920
So, with just a click or two, you can

0:01:17.920,0:01:20.961
deploy all of that great code to App Engine. And

0:01:20.961,0:01:24.670
of course, you can have many applications running there. And

0:01:24.670,0:01:27.670
when you and your front-end developer friend have finished your

0:01:27.670,0:01:30.850
application. You tell all your users about how cool

0:01:30.850,0:01:33.650
it is, and that they can start using it. And

0:01:33.650,0:01:36.970
when you use App Engine, it's very easy to support

0:01:36.970,0:01:41.330
any kind of device and operating system. Computers, smartphones, tablets.

0:01:41.330,0:01:44.650
You name it. And hopefully, the users will think

0:01:44.650,0:01:47.740
your application is so cool, that they will tell their

0:01:47.740,0:01:50.660
friends about how cool it is. And hopefully they will

0:01:50.660,0:01:54.660
tell their friends. And your application goes all viral. And

0:01:54.660,0:01:57.800
you get all of these great ratings and recognitions. And

0:01:57.800,0:02:01.100
awards and stuff. But you don't need to worry about

0:02:01.100,0:02:04.280
your site going down because it has become so popular,

0:02:04.280,0:02:06.390
since you built it on the Google cloud. It will

0:02:06.390,0:02:10.990
scale and scale, and scale on the Google infrastructure.

0:02:10.990,0:02:13.020
So you get to feel like a million bucks. And

0:02:13.020,0:02:16.120
become a rock start developer that everyone wants to be

0:02:16.120,0:02:19.850
with. This is exactly what we would like to happen.

0:02:19.850,0:02:22.780
And that's really what this is all about. App Engine

0:02:22.780,0:02:26.470
and Google cloud platform, allows you to create applications that

0:02:26.470,0:02:28.990
run in Google data centers. And can be used by

0:02:28.990,0:02:31.860
any device. So you can sit with your laptop and

0:02:31.860,0:02:34.270
create apps that scale to serve billions of

0:02:34.270,0:02:37.270
users worldwide. It's really, really cool when you think

0:02:37.270,0:02:39.950
about it. Well, hang in there. Because you're

0:02:39.950,0:02:42.670
just about to create your first App Engine project.
