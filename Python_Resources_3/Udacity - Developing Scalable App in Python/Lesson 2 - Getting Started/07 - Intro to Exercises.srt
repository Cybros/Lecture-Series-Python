Hi, welcome.

0:00:01.770,0:00:04.700
I'll be guiding you through[br]the coding lessons in this class.

0:00:04.700,0:00:08.230
The first thing you'll do is deploy a[br]simple app engine application that uses

0:00:08.230,0:00:09.350
endpoints.

0:00:09.350,0:00:11.720
You'll learn how to define[br]endpoint functions.

0:00:11.720,0:00:14.632
You'll learn how to call an endpoint[br]function from a webpage using

0:00:14.632,0:00:16.091
the JavaScript client library.

0:00:16.091,0:00:19.520
You'll also learn how to use the APIs[br]Explorer, which is a cool tool for

0:00:19.520,0:00:21.865
exploring publicly[br]available Google APIs, and

0:00:21.865,0:00:24.680
which also lets you test out[br]your own application's API.

0:00:24.680,0:00:27.470
The main coding project[br]that you'll be building in

0:00:27.470,0:00:30.260
this course is an application[br]called Conference Central.

0:00:30.260,0:00:34.360
It let's users schedule conferences and[br]also register to attend conferences.

0:00:34.360,0:00:37.320
You'll be focusing on implementing[br]the backend functions.

0:00:37.320,0:00:39.860
Just like on a cooking show[br]where some of the cakes

0:00:39.860,0:00:43.120
are already baked ahead of time,[br]we've written some of the code for you,

0:00:43.120,0:00:46.870
so that you can get straight to work[br]implementing the more interesting bits.

0:00:46.870,0:00:49.660
You'll start out by downloading[br]a skeleton version of the conference

0:00:49.660,0:00:51.140
central application.

0:00:51.140,0:00:54.110
Then, you can keep working on it,[br]from lesson to lesson.

0:00:54.110,0:00:57.960
But, at any point, if you don't complete[br]the exercises in a lesson, don't worry.

0:00:57.960,0:01:00.510
We provide new starting code for[br]each lesson.

0:01:00.510,0:01:02.530
Okay, let's go write[br]some endpoint functions.
