0:00:00.640,0:00:03.030
Okay, so now we have registered an app engine

0:00:03.030,0:00:05.220
project and we are almost ready to do some

0:00:05.220,0:00:07.920
coding. But just before we do that, let's talk

0:00:07.920,0:00:12.410
about supporting different devices for a while. One big challenge

0:00:12.410,0:00:14.960
when designing service-side applications today is that there are

0:00:14.960,0:00:18.140
so many different devices from so many different vendors

0:00:18.140,0:00:22.330
that you need to support. Different browsers, smartphone, tablets

0:00:22.330,0:00:25.700
and computer. All having different API's that should be used.

0:00:26.880,0:00:30.990
Initially, we will be using the browser for our course project. But later we

0:00:30.990,0:00:35.060
will be able to support a mobile phone without rewriting a single line of code.

0:00:37.140,0:00:38.895
Having to consider this when you design your

0:00:38.895,0:00:41.960
server-side application is a lot of work. So how

0:00:41.960,0:00:45.130
can we solve this problem? Well, the Google Cloud

0:00:45.130,0:00:47.380
platform has solved this problem for you with a

0:00:47.380,0:00:51.530
product called Cloud Endpoints. When you use Cloud Endpoints

0:00:51.530,0:00:53.980
you can create one single API for your server

0:00:53.980,0:00:59.230
application called a Cloud Endpoint API. Cloud Endpoints can

0:00:59.230,0:01:02.360
then generate a client side API for many different

0:01:02.360,0:01:06.440
devices from many different vendors. This is great of

0:01:06.440,0:01:08.880
course because it allows you to focus on just

0:01:08.880,0:01:12.190
server side application and Cloud Endpoints will make sure

0:01:12.190,0:01:15.670
that it supports many different devices. You will learn a

0:01:15.670,0:01:18.590
lot more about Cloud Endpoints since we will use

0:01:18.590,0:01:21.640
it when we build out the course project. Enough

0:01:21.640,0:01:24.390
said, we have now created an app engine project

0:01:24.390,0:01:27.100
using the developer's console and looked at the benefits of

0:01:27.100,0:01:29.380
Cloud Endpoints. It's time for you to

0:01:29.380,0:01:31.220
get a development environment up and running.
