There are two things to do.

0:00:01.460,0:00:05.440
Your end points method need to accept[br]two arguments, period and name.

0:00:05.440,0:00:06.530
Both of them are strings, so

0:00:06.530,0:00:09.790
you have to create a new resource[br]container with two fields.

0:00:09.790,0:00:11.800
And then you can define[br]the method itself.

0:00:11.800,0:00:15.520
The request will be handled by the same[br]request container you just wrote.

0:00:15.520,0:00:17.800
The output will be the same hello class.

0:00:17.800,0:00:19.710
And the path will be greet[br]by period as we said.
