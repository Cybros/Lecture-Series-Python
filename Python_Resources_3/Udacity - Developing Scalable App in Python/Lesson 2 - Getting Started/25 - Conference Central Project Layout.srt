Now it's time to start working on[br]the Conference Central application.

0:00:03.140,0:00:07.150
Hopefully you've already cloned or[br]downloaded the code from our repository

0:00:07.150,0:00:11.250
but if not just follow the link in[br]the instructor notes and do so now.

0:00:11.250,0:00:13.455
We provide starting code for[br]each lesson.

0:00:13.455,0:00:15.575
You can start with the code for[br]this lesson and

0:00:15.575,0:00:19.155
keep working on it throughout the[br]course, or, at any point, if you need,

0:00:19.155,0:00:21.765
you can download the starting code for[br]the lesson that you're in.

0:00:21.765,0:00:23.015
You might want to do that, for example,

0:00:23.015,0:00:26.427
if you don't finish all the coding[br]exercises for a previous lesson.

0:00:26.427,0:00:30.325
As you can see the project layout is[br]similar to the hello endpoints project.

0:00:30.325,0:00:31.817
There are some more static files for

0:00:31.817,0:00:35.272
the front end however and the backend[br]is split up into several files.

0:00:35.272,0:00:39.153
Settings.py for the project specific[br]configuration to web client idea.

0:00:39.153,0:00:44.248
Models.py for the ndb model, and[br]protorpc message definitions.

0:00:44.248,0:00:48.415
Conference.py for the main application[br]logic, and app.yaml provides

0:00:48.415,0:00:52.057
the application settings,[br]same as in the hello endpoints app.
