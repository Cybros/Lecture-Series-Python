0:00:00.630,0:00:02.830
Okay. So we now come to the part where

0:00:02.830,0:00:06.090
we will create a new project for App Engine. You

0:00:06.090,0:00:09.180
create new projects using the developer console, which can be

0:00:09.180,0:00:12.630
accessed at this URL. This is a console that allows

0:00:12.630,0:00:15.420
you to configure many different Google services. But in

0:00:15.420,0:00:18.450
this course we will focus on the App Engine specific

0:00:18.450,0:00:22.620
parts. Go there and create a new project. We will

0:00:22.620,0:00:25.740
talk about installing the development environment a bit later on,

0:00:25.740,0:00:28.950
so don't worry about that right now. While creating

0:00:28.950,0:00:31.630
the project, you will be presented with the following dialog

0:00:31.630,0:00:35.360
box. Pay special attention to the project ID. The project

0:00:35.360,0:00:38.800
ID must be unique and it has certain naming restrictions.

0:00:38.800,0:00:41.150
Having a project ID you're happy with, though, can

0:00:41.150,0:00:44.630
be quite handy, since you can access your application through

0:00:44.630,0:00:48.893
a URL containing it. After you've created your project, this

0:00:48.893,0:00:50.696
is the URL that you can use to access it.

0:00:50.696,0:00:55.028
So in this example, the final URL will become

0:00:55.028,0:01:01.312
http://apt-octagon-533.appspot.com. See, that's the

0:01:01.312,0:01:06.990
project ID was this. So it's now time for you to go and create your new project.
