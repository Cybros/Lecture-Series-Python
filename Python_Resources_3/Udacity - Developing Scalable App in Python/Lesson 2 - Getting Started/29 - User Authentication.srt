Congratulations, you just did a lot of stuff. Let's do

0:00:03.270,0:00:06.069
a recap. You've wrote your first lines of code and

0:00:06.069,0:00:08.773
deployed it to App Engine. You got Conference Central up

0:00:08.773,0:00:13.550
and running. And you've tried out the API Explorer. Don't underestimate

0:00:13.550,0:00:16.610
the API Explorer. It's a great tool to use to

0:00:16.610,0:00:19.070
try out the APIs. And it's not limited to your

0:00:19.070,0:00:21.710
own APIs, you can use it for any Google API.

0:00:21.710,0:00:26.810
So, all good stuff. But let's now talk about user authentication.

0:00:26.810,0:00:30.490
Many applications require that a user is registered and

0:00:30.490,0:00:35.080
signed in before using the application. We will also require

0:00:35.080,0:00:37.680
this for Conference Central, so let's look at how

0:00:37.680,0:00:40.110
we do that. It used to be the case that

0:00:40.110,0:00:42.820
almost every application had to create their own user

0:00:42.820,0:00:46.140
management system. That would mean that you would have to

0:00:46.140,0:00:48.600
write all the code from scratch in order for

0:00:48.600,0:00:52.150
your users to use your applications. Well, good for us.

0:00:52.150,0:00:54.700
That is not needed anymore. With App Engine, you

0:00:54.700,0:00:57.800
can use third party authentication with Cloud Endpoints, such

0:00:57.800,0:01:00.260
as Google Plus sign-in. But also other ones can

0:01:00.260,0:01:04.450
be used. In Conference Central, we will require a Google

0:01:04.450,0:01:07.170
account for sign-in. So, how do we know that

0:01:07.170,0:01:09.810
the user is signed into their Google account when they

0:01:09.810,0:01:12.830
use Conference Central? That is actually taking care of

0:01:12.830,0:01:17.620
by Cloud Endpoints. A Cloud Endpoint's API method can optionally

0:01:17.620,0:01:21.320
take a user object as its first argument and

0:01:21.320,0:01:23.640
if the user object is not null then the

0:01:23.640,0:01:26.470
user is signed in, but if it's null then

0:01:26.470,0:01:29.380
we throw in exception which decline should receive and

0:01:29.380,0:01:32.540
redirect for sign in. Could it be more easy?

0:01:33.775,0:01:36.590
Hm, you might say now. But what about security

0:01:36.590,0:01:39.760
and privacy? Well, that is all taken care of

0:01:39.760,0:01:43.850
by Google Sign in or a third party authentication provider.

0:01:43.850,0:01:47.780
So this mechanism is the best of two worlds combined. A simple way

0:01:47.780,0:01:51.970
to add user authentication to your app, combined with the strong security and

0:01:51.970,0:01:57.410
privacy standards of Google, all right, that's enough talking, time for you do

0:01:57.410,0:01:59.240
some coding again by adding user

0:01:59.240,0:02:01.900
authentication to your Conference Central. Good luck.
