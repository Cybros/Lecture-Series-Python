0:00:00.000,0:00:03.456
Let's first go through the process of[br]running and testing a project locally,

0:00:03.456,0:00:04.827
then deploying to App Engine.

0:00:04.827,0:00:06.759
The app's very simple, and[br]it runs out of the box.

0:00:06.759,0:00:08.878
Let's first run it and[br]see what it does, and

0:00:08.878,0:00:11.241
then take a look at the code[br]that makes it happen.

0:00:11.241,0:00:13.563
First, open up App Engine Launcher.

0:00:13.563,0:00:17.440
Add a new project and point to the[br]directory for the hello endpoints app.

0:00:17.440,0:00:20.548
As you can see it gets added and[br]it will set a port for

0:00:20.548,0:00:24.407
the web interface and[br]different one for the admin interface.

0:00:24.407,0:00:27.183
The default port for[br]app engine is 80/80.

0:00:27.183,0:00:29.763
If you add several projects[br]to the launcher, the port for

0:00:29.763,0:00:32.256
the next app you add to[br]the launcher will be different.

0:00:32.256,0:00:34.881
So when testing locally,[br]pay attention to that port number.

0:00:34.881,0:00:36.657
Click the green Run button.

0:00:36.657,0:00:39.975
Then click on the Logs button to[br]see the deployment process, and

0:00:39.975,0:00:41.394
if there are any problems.

0:00:41.394,0:00:42.276
Look at the logs.

0:00:42.276,0:00:44.959
Once the app is deployed,[br]you'll see several lines.

0:00:44.959,0:00:48.082
One will tell you the URL and the port[br]that the app can be accessed at.

0:00:48.082,0:00:51.138
When you go to the URL for[br]that starting module default,

0:00:51.138,0:00:52.576
you should see this page.

0:00:52.576,0:00:54.317
Hm, it looks really basic.

0:00:54.317,0:00:57.216
Since this course is about[br]the back end part of the app,

0:00:57.216,0:01:00.320
we haven't put any CSS or[br]any other front end work into it.

0:01:00.320,0:01:02.201
So click on the buttons and[br]see what happens.

0:01:02.201,0:01:07.942
You know, my name's not actually Zebra,[br]so I'm going to change that.

0:01:07.942,0:01:10.326
That's much better.

0:01:10.326,0:01:11.033
Okay, great.

0:01:11.033,0:01:12.228
The local server works.

0:01:12.228,0:01:14.730
But if you want other people[br]to be able to access your app,

0:01:14.730,0:01:16.408
you have to deploy it onto App Engine.

0:01:16.408,0:01:17.197
Let's do that.

0:01:17.197,0:01:18.393
It's actually almost as easy.

0:01:18.393,0:01:22.073
You just press the deploy button and[br]it'll want your Google login.

0:01:22.073,0:01:23.793
The password is swordfish, by the way.

0:01:23.793,0:01:27.148
Let's take a look in the logs and[br]see how the deployment process goes.

0:01:27.148,0:01:31.491
Hm, appcfg.py has finished[br]with exit code one.

0:01:31.491,0:01:33.813
Exit code one is usually[br]not a good deal.

0:01:33.813,0:01:35.665
Let's see up here.

0:01:35.665,0:01:36.914
Begin server output.

0:01:36.914,0:01:38.609
This application does not exist.

0:01:38.609,0:01:42.034
App ID equals you, your project ID.

0:01:42.034,0:01:44.509
Oh, it's complaining that[br]it can't deploy to that.

0:01:44.509,0:01:45.414
That's right.

0:01:45.414,0:01:48.990
You have to actually enter your own[br]app ID into the configuration first.

0:01:48.990,0:01:51.270
So remember when you[br]created an App Engine app,

0:01:51.270,0:01:53.787
get that project ID from[br]the developer's console.

0:01:53.787,0:01:56.388
Don't use the one that you see in[br]this video, it won't work for you.

0:01:56.388,0:01:57.351
Get your own.

0:01:57.351,0:02:01.239
Then, in the code,[br]open up app.yaml, and replace your

0:02:01.239,0:02:06.187
project ID in the application line[br]with the one you got from the console.

0:02:06.187,0:02:07.720
And save that.

0:02:07.720,0:02:10.758
And when you go back to Google App[br]Engine Launcher you'll see that the name

0:02:10.758,0:02:11.690
has already changed.

0:02:11.690,0:02:14.211
Now you can deploy the app and

0:02:14.211,0:02:20.319
watch in the logs as it gets sent to[br]app engine compiled and deployed.

0:02:20.319,0:02:24.449
Eventually, you'll see,[br]completed updated of app, and

0:02:24.449,0:02:28.339
the URL for your app will[br]be your app id.appspot.com.

0:02:28.339,0:02:33.297
If you go to your app id.appspot.com,[br]you should see the very same thing.

0:02:33.297,0:02:36.397
So you now have the app running[br]both locally and on App Engine.

0:02:36.397,0:02:38.498
So now it's time to[br]explore how it works.

0:02:38.498,0:02:39.960
Let's take a look back at the code.

0:02:39.960,0:02:44.594
Let's take a look at helloworldapi.py,[br]and here we go, endpoints.api,

0:02:44.594,0:02:46.034
that sounds familiar.

0:02:46.034,0:02:48.356
Look at this, endpoints.method.

0:02:48.356,0:02:51.203
Hm, one of these things,[br]endpoints.api and

0:02:51.203,0:02:54.637
endpoints.method, oh this[br]uses Python decorators.

0:02:54.637,0:02:56.850
Maybe we should talk about those first.
