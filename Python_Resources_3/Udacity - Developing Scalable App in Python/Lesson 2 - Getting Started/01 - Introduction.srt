Hi, we hope you're now all excited to build

0:00:03.320,0:00:07.510
scalable applications using App Engine and the Google Cloud platform.

0:00:07.510,0:00:09.590
In this lesson, we'll get down to the nuts and

0:00:09.590,0:00:12.840
bolts of everything, and have you deploy your first code

0:00:12.840,0:00:15.340
to App Engine. This will involve an number of

0:00:15.340,0:00:18.260
different steps, but don't worry, we'll all do it in

0:00:18.260,0:00:21.420
a structured and orderly fashion to make sure you're on

0:00:21.420,0:00:25.180
your way to become a rock star App Engine developer.

0:00:26.260,0:00:27.870
So let's look at what we're going to do in

0:00:27.870,0:00:31.300
this lesson. First, we're going to look at the App Engine development

0:00:31.300,0:00:33.760
cycle and create an App Engine project where you can

0:00:33.760,0:00:37.270
upload your code. Then we're going to look at cloud endpoints that

0:00:37.270,0:00:39.820
allows you to create a backend that can work with

0:00:39.820,0:00:44.160
any frontend device technology. After that, we'll get you started with

0:00:44.160,0:00:47.740
a development environment where you develop code for App Engine. And

0:00:47.740,0:00:51.480
then, we'll introduce Conference Central, the application that we will build

0:00:51.480,0:00:55.250
out throughout this course. At the end of this lesson, you'll have a

0:00:55.250,0:00:58.130
working application running in the Google Cloud.

0:00:59.430,0:01:01.730
Isn't that exciting? Let's go, shall we?
