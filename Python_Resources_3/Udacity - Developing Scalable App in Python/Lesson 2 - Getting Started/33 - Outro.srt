In this lesson, we looked at the App Engine

development cycle and how to create an App Engine

0:00:08.500,0:00:11.650
project. We also looked at Cloud Endpoints that allows

0:00:11.650,0:00:14.430
you to build a single backend that can work

0:00:14.430,0:00:18.370
with many different frontend device technologies. Together with Cloud

0:00:18.370,0:00:22.420
Endpoints, we explore the API explorer, that allows you

0:00:22.420,0:00:25.550
