A Team is probably best modeled as a Kind.

0:00:04.310,0:00:07.460
It's a concrete structure that can have many entities.

0:00:07.460,0:00:10.380
A Game is also best modeled as a Kind,

0:00:10.380,0:00:13.500
for the same reasons as for Team. The Winning

0:00:13.500,0:00:16.590
Team is probably best modeled as an Entity. But,

0:00:16.590,0:00:18.840
this answer is not so straightforward. It could, for

0:00:18.840,0:00:22.480
example, be a Property Value in an Entity. A

0:00:22.480,0:00:25.520
Player is probably best modeled as a Kind for

0:00:25.520,0:00:29.910
the same reasons as Team and Game. And, the Player Name sounds

0:00:29.910,0:00:33.800
like it's modeled through a Property Value. I hope you did well on

0:00:33.800,0:00:38.320
the quiz. All right, that's an introduction to DataStore. Now, it's about time

0:00:38.320,0:00:41.880
to check out some code, don't you think? Let's do that. Good luck.
