0:00:00.240,0:00:01.400
And, here's the solution.

0:00:01.400,0:00:05.540
You need to retrieve a profile entity,[br]so the class here is Profile.

0:00:05.540,0:00:10.020
And then,[br]you use the user key to get the entity.

0:00:10.020,0:00:10.760
Over here in our code,

0:00:10.760,0:00:14.480
probably see something very[br]much like this, and like that.

0:00:14.480,0:00:17.480
So now, your app's profile, saving,[br]getting, and updating functionality,

0:00:17.480,0:00:18.840
should be complete, as well.

0:00:18.840,0:00:19.340
Good job.
