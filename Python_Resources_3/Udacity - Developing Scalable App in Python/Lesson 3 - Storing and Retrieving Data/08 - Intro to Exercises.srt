In this lesson you'll learn[br]how to define entity classes.

0:00:03.910,0:00:08.109
We'll use an entity class called[br]Profile to save user profiles.

0:00:08.109,0:00:11.290
You'll learn how to get a user ID for[br]the logged in user so

0:00:11.290,0:00:14.730
you can use it as the unique ID for[br]the entity's key.

0:00:14.730,0:00:17.520
We'll explore the entities in the data[br]store by using the data store

0:00:17.520,0:00:19.400
viewer in the Admin Console.

0:00:19.400,0:00:22.220
And it's not much good putting data[br]into the data store if we can't get

0:00:22.220,0:00:23.430
it back out.

0:00:23.430,0:00:27.040
So you'll learn how to get the profile[br]entities back out of the datastore.

0:00:27.040,0:00:27.810
So let's get into that.
