So, when we saved a new profile and look[br]in the data store, we see fields for

0:00:04.170,0:00:07.050

0:00:07.050,0:00:09.040
We don't see any User ID field.

0:00:09.040,0:00:12.430
That's because we used the User ID to[br]create the key for the entity, but

0:00:12.430,0:00:13.980
it's not stored as a separate property.
