0:00:00.000,0:00:00.781
So right now,

0:00:00.781,0:00:04.834
the saveProfile method only returns[br]a profile without really saving it.

0:00:04.834,0:00:09.217
And the getProfile from user function[br]will change all of the fields back to

0:00:09.217,0:00:10.778
the defaults every time.

0:00:10.778,0:00:13.946
That means that if we use it from the[br]front-end every time we'd have to fill

0:00:13.946,0:00:15.979
in the correct values to[br]replace the defaults.

0:00:15.979,0:00:20.400
Instead, we probably want to get the[br]existing entity from the datastore and

0:00:20.400,0:00:22.550
maybe just update one field not all.

0:00:22.550,0:00:26.760
So the getProfileFromUser function[br]should actually get a saved profile from

0:00:26.760,0:00:27.666
the datastore,

0:00:27.666,0:00:31.048
instead of always creating a new[br]one from the default values.

0:00:31.048,0:00:32.418
Let's see how to do that.

0:00:32.418,0:00:34.352
Getting an entity from the datastore,

0:00:34.352,0:00:36.760
if you know the entity's[br]key is extremely easy.

0:00:36.760,0:00:40.475
You just perform get[br]on the key like this.

0:00:40.475,0:00:42.750
So now,[br]it's your turn to do this in your app.

0:00:42.750,0:00:46.364
Since you're already creating the[br]profile key, all you need to do is get

0:00:46.364,0:00:49.693
the entity from the datastore[br]instead of defining that it's not.

0:00:49.693,0:00:52.540
And then in doProfile,[br]if you get a save_request,

0:00:52.540,0:00:55.985
we also want to put the modified[br]profile back to the datastore.

0:00:55.985,0:00:59.607
And of course, don't forget to deploy[br]your app to local host and test.

0:00:59.607,0:01:02.170
So, as you complete each one[br]of these check them off and

0:01:02.170,0:01:05.430
then fill in this missing code to[br]fetch a profile from the datastore.
