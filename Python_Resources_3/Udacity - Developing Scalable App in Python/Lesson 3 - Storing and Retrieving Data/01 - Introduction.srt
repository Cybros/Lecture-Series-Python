So now when you're up and running with conference

0:00:02.380,0:00:05.060
central you have a pretty good idea of how to

0:00:05.060,0:00:08.770
write and deploy app engine applications. In the last lesson

0:00:08.770,0:00:12.210
we also covered usage management and we added it to

0:00:12.210,0:00:16.050
conference central so only authenticated users can access the application.

0:00:17.420,0:00:20.140
When you write applications you very often need to store

0:00:20.140,0:00:22.390
data. And as you know, there are a number of

0:00:22.390,0:00:26.080
ways you can do this. App Engine is no exception.

0:00:26.080,0:00:30.790
It can work with a number of different storage technologies.

0:00:30.790,0:00:35.566
But there is one that is particularly important, it's called Datastore.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

0:00:40.978,0:00:44.840
This is the Big Table restaurant here at Google. You may have heard of Big

0:00:44.840,0:00:48.290
Table. It's a technology Google created and

0:00:48.290,0:00:52.960
published a famous paper about in 2006. Big

0:00:52.960,0:00:56.360
Table allows unlimited amount of data to

0:00:56.360,0:00:59.310
be stored and searched effectively. And many of

0:00:59.310,0:01:02.400
the huge services being run here at Google

0:01:02.400,0:01:05.310
chose Big Table to store data. You know

0:01:05.310,0:01:10.530
what? App Engine Datastore also uses Big Table. That means

0:01:10.530,0:01:15.220
that your applications ge the same massive scale. Isn't that great?

0:01:17.320,0:01:23.660
Hm, but I'm starting to feel a little bit hungry. Hey! I think I'll go in,

0:01:23.660,0:01:31.024
and get a big bite in the Big Table restaurant! See you in class! [NOISE]
