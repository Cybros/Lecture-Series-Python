0:00:00.610,0:00:01.980
As we saw in the previous code

0:00:01.980,0:00:05.130
example, properties can have different types. These are

0:00:05.130,0:00:08.860
called property types. For the recipe kind, some

0:00:08.860,0:00:11.495
of the property names and types were name,

0:00:11.495,0:00:15.841
which was a string. Vegetarian, a boolean indicator.

0:00:15.841,0:00:19.490
And the number of servings, an integer. But

0:00:19.490,0:00:22.135
these are just a few property types. In

0:00:22.135,0:00:25.530
fact, Datastore supports a lot more property types.

0:00:25.530,0:00:28.113
And we mean, a lot. The

0:00:28.113,0:00:31.403
official documentation on developers.google.com lists around

0:00:31.403,0:00:34.870
20 of them. In this class, we're only going to use a small

0:00:34.870,0:00:38.440
subset of these. And the ones you can see listed here are some

0:00:38.440,0:00:41.245
of the most common properties. Integers.

0:00:41.245,0:00:46.080
Floating-point numbers. Strings. Dates and binary data.
