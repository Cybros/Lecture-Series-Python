Let's look at the answer. A bank account

0:00:03.330,0:00:06.050
number, that sounds pretty unique. So that could be

0:00:06.050,0:00:09.990
a good candidate to have as a keyname/ID. A

0:00:09.990,0:00:13.930
date, is probably not a good keyname/ID, because it's

0:00:13.930,0:00:16.500
most likely not unique across the entities. But

0:00:16.500,0:00:18.440
it could be. It all depends on the modeling,

0:00:18.440,0:00:21.370
of course. The price, does not sound like a

0:00:21.370,0:00:24.290
good keyname/ID either for the same reasons I stated.

0:00:25.750,0:00:30.060
An email address. Yeah, that could be a good keyname/ID. Because it's

0:00:30.060,0:00:33.880
very likely, it's unique across entities. All right. I hope you did well.
