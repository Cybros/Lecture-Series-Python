Welcome back. I hope that exercise went great.

0:00:04.480,0:00:08.023
Now, let's talk about another important Datastore concept,

0:00:08.023,0:00:11.188
keys. When you store an entity in the

0:00:11.188,0:00:14.100
Datastore, the Datastore will assign a key to

0:00:14.100,0:00:18.030
it. This key uniquely identifies the entity and

0:00:18.030,0:00:20.380
it's used for many different purposes. They are

0:00:20.380,0:00:25.775
two ways a key can be generated. Let's take a look. The first one is when

0:00:25.775,0:00:29.480
Datastore automatically generates this key. Let's say we

0:00:29.480,0:00:32.970
define the profile kind with these properties. And inserted

0:00:32.970,0:00:35.660
it for the first time. In this case, the

0:00:35.660,0:00:39.080
Datastore will automatically assign a key value to it.

0:00:39.080,0:00:44.970
The other way is that you specify what is called a key name or ID. In this case,

0:00:44.970,0:00:48.440
Datastore will use that value to generate the key.

0:00:48.440,0:00:50.870
This is a good alternative when you have something

0:00:50.870,0:00:53.900
that is unique for each entity. Because it can clearly

0:00:53.900,0:00:56.560
take us to our front entity based on this value

0:00:56.560,0:01:00.235
so it's easier to find. But observe that statement. The

0:01:00.235,0:01:04.610
Keyname/ID must be unique for all entities of that kind. For

0:01:04.610,0:01:07.450
our profile kind that is exactly the case because we

0:01:07.450,0:01:09.980
have decided to use the user ID to to uniquely

0:01:09.980,0:01:13.820
identify each profile identity. The value of having user ID

0:01:13.820,0:01:16.360
as the key name is that we can retrieve the profile

0:01:16.360,0:01:20.310
entity directly using this value. And remember, since the

0:01:20.310,0:01:23.500
user object is the first parameter to cloud endpoints API

0:01:23.500,0:01:25.950
methods. It will become a convenient way to get

0:01:25.950,0:01:29.720
the profile, but we'll look more into this later. If

0:01:29.720,0:01:32.770
you are familiar with relational database modeling, you probably

0:01:32.770,0:01:35.100
see that this is very similar to the concept of

0:01:35.100,0:01:39.110
a primary key. There, as well as with Datastore,

0:01:39.110,0:01:41.490
you have the option of letting the database generate the

0:01:41.490,0:01:44.460
primary key or use the value of your choice.

0:01:44.460,0:01:46.620
But now, it's for you to do some work
