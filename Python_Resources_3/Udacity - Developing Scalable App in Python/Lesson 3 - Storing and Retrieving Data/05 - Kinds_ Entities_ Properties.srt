0:00:00.250,0:00:04.021
So now it's time to cover the building blocks to use when doing datestore

0:00:04.021,0:00:08.581
modelling. They are kind, entity, and

0:00:08.581,0:00:14.040
property. Let's start with kind shall we? A kind

0:00:14.040,0:00:15.780
is a name that defines a particular

0:00:15.780,0:00:19.500
structure. For our conference central application, two different

0:00:19.500,0:00:23.410
kinds are, for example, profile and conference.

0:00:23.410,0:00:25.460
A kind is similar to the concept of

0:00:25.460,0:00:29.230
classes in object oriented programming. Given a kind

0:00:29.230,0:00:31.650
you can create many entities of that kind, so

0:00:31.650,0:00:34.360
in this picture we can do three entities, one

0:00:34.360,0:00:36.710
for the profile kind and two for the conference

0:00:36.710,0:00:40.880
kind. And as you can see entities are very

0:00:40.880,0:00:43.990
similar to the concept of objects in object oriented

0:00:43.990,0:00:48.170
programming, and each entity holds a set of properties

0:00:48.170,0:00:50.570
which are highlighted by the red sections in this

0:00:50.570,0:00:53.460
picture, and by now you can see that

0:00:53.460,0:00:56.830
properties are very similar to the concept of fields,

0:00:56.830,0:01:00.637
members, or attributes in object oriented programming. In

0:01:00.637,0:01:03.257
fact, you can also find similarities with the relational

0:01:03.257,0:01:05.620
of database modeling. Let's look at the table

0:01:05.620,0:01:09.820
that summarizes these things. So the kind in app

0:01:09.820,0:01:12.670
engine datastore can be thought of as a class

0:01:12.670,0:01:15.830
in object oriented programming and as a table in

0:01:15.830,0:01:19.405
relational database model, and an entity in app engine

0:01:19.405,0:01:21.750
datastore can be thought of as an object in

0:01:21.750,0:01:24.780
object oriented programming or as a row in relational

0:01:24.780,0:01:28.890
database modeling. And finally, a property in Datastore can

0:01:28.890,0:01:31.140
be thought of as a field or attribute in

0:01:31.140,0:01:34.250
object oriented programming, and that's a colomn, in relational

0:01:34.250,0:01:37.920
database modeling. But, this is on a very high

0:01:37.920,0:01:41.060
level. Since there are many things that differ in Datastore

0:01:41.060,0:01:43.930
compared to the other technologies, you shouldn't consider these

0:01:43.930,0:01:46.590
as direct technology. It could help you out in the

0:01:46.590,0:01:49.200
beginning, but as we dig deeper into how data store

0:01:49.200,0:01:52.110
works, you will start to see more and more differences
