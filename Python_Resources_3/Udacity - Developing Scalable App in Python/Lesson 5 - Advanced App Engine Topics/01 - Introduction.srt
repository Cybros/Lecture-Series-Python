I'm standing here by the Google Corkboard

0:00:03.116,0:00:07.520
Server Rack. This server rack was built in

0:00:07.520,0:00:10.840
1999 by Google employees simply because you

0:00:10.840,0:00:13.770
could not buy the computers required to achieve

0:00:13.770,0:00:17.390
the scale, reliability, and performance that Google

0:00:17.390,0:00:20.770
required. Each row here, has eight hard drives

0:00:20.770,0:00:25.880
on it, and four complete PCs. And there is a cork mat, to shield the electronics

0:00:25.880,0:00:28.370
from the metal frame that carries the row up.

0:00:28.370,0:00:31.130
That's why it was called the Google Corkboard Server

0:00:31.130,0:00:34.480
Rack. When your application runs on the Google Cloud

0:00:34.480,0:00:36.720
platform, you can be sure it runs on the

0:00:36.720,0:00:41.140
latest and best hardware. Well, perhaps not this version

0:00:41.140,0:00:45.510
from 1999. But the latest version that we built.

0:00:45.510,0:00:48.410
So, in this lesson we're going to cover the heavy

0:00:48.410,0:00:51.710
duty stuff. We'll start it off by looking at memcash,

0:00:51.710,0:00:55.370
a great way to optimize the performance of your application, then we'll

0:00:55.370,0:00:58.975
look at background jobs. In the form of push queues, pull queues,

0:00:58.975,0:01:01.840
and cron jobs and we'll wrap it up by looking at some

0:01:01.840,0:01:06.930
of the scaling and tuning parameters for appendium. Let's get started, shall we?
