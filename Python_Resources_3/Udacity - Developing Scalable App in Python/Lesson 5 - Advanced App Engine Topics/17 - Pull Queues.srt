So here are the answers. A package delivery service sounds

0:00:03.610,0:00:07.220
like a pull queue because each package is probably delivered by

0:00:07.220,0:00:10.680
independent workers that can pull tasks from the queue. What

0:00:10.680,0:00:13.500
about checking in for a flight? Well I would like to

0:00:13.500,0:00:15.810
know that I'm checked in, and in that case it's

0:00:15.810,0:00:19.460
neither a push queue nor a pull queue. Then the confirmation

0:00:19.460,0:00:22.630
would be delivered as part of the http response, even if

0:00:22.630,0:00:25.490
it takes a little bit of time. This is a situation

0:00:25.490,0:00:28.050
very similar to when you buy things using a credit

0:00:28.050,0:00:30.840
card on the internet, where you also often wait for

0:00:30.840,0:00:34.460
the response. What about code review? Well a code review

0:00:34.460,0:00:37.680
sounds like a pull queue, because you probably have many people

0:00:37.680,0:00:40.500
that can review the code, so the first one that's

0:00:40.500,0:00:44.010
available can pull the code review from the queue. And then

0:00:44.010,0:00:46.690
batch processing of images, which sounds like a push queue.

0:00:47.710,0:00:50.530
This is because your code is probably doing the processing of

0:00:50.530,0:00:53.340
the images. Therefore you want to have control over the execution.
