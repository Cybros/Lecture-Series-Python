0:00:00.320,0:00:01.870
So here we are in app.yaml.

0:00:01.870,0:00:05.540
And here's the new configuration for[br]sending confirmation email.

0:00:05.540,0:00:08.960
Then in main.py, here's the new[br]SendConfirmationEmailHandler,

0:00:08.960,0:00:09.500
which we've added.

0:00:09.500,0:00:13.530
And then in conference.py, whenever[br]a conference is created, right after

0:00:13.530,0:00:16.920
putting it into the datastore,[br]we now add the task to send the email.
