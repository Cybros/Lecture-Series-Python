So we've talked about push and pull queues now. But

0:00:03.090,0:00:05.750
what if you just want to do something at regular intervals?

0:00:05.750,0:00:09.670
For example, perform a backup, remove temporary files or send a

0:00:09.670,0:00:13.560
daily report at midnight every day. That's exactly what a Cron

0:00:13.560,0:00:16.980
job does. It's a scheduler. An app engine cron job

0:00:16.980,0:00:19.480
is very similar to a cron job in Unix, if you

0:00:19.480,0:00:22.556
have worked with that. So, cron is a scheduler within app

0:00:22.556,0:00:26.860
engine that allows you to specify tasks that are executed regularly.

0:00:26.860,0:00:29.870
Cron is perfect to use to perform background tasks, which

0:00:29.870,0:00:33.690
are not directly initiated from user activity. For example, to

0:00:33.690,0:00:36.980
run batch or synchronization jobs of different kinds and back

0:00:36.980,0:00:40.780
ups, etc. The cron job is very easy to configure

0:00:40.780,0:00:43.770
and there are two things you need to specify. First

0:00:43.770,0:00:46.390
of all, the URL that should be called. This is

0:00:46.390,0:00:49.220
where you place the code you want to execute and

0:00:49.220,0:00:52.490
then you also need to specify the schedule which controls

0:00:52.490,0:00:57.150
when the task URL is called and as with the Queues there is a ten minute

0:00:57.150,0:00:59.710
limit for dynamic instances. If you want more

0:00:59.710,0:01:02.020
time than that, you can use resident instances.
