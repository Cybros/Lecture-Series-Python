Okay, let's do a little quiz called, how to optimize? So as rows

0:00:04.930,0:00:08.480
here, we have objectives. Optimize application code,

0:00:08.480,0:00:11.540
reduce latency for static content, make app

0:00:11.540,0:00:14.810
more responsive, reduce data store reads

0:00:14.810,0:00:18.280
and improve performance as user base grows.

0:00:18.280,0:00:20.690
And as columns, we have different optimization

0:00:20.690,0:00:25.520
techniques. Edge caching, mem cache, automatic scaling,

0:00:25.520,0:00:28.570
app stats, and queues. Please select

0:00:28.570,0:00:31.300
the appropriate optimization strategy for the different

0:00:31.300,0:00:34.150
objectives. There could be more optimization

0:00:34.150,0:00:36.850
techniques for a single objective. Good luck.
