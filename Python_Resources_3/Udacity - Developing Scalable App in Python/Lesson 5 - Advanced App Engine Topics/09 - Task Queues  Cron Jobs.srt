0:00:00.240,0:00:02.310
So let's look at another feature that is needed

0:00:02.310,0:00:05.570
to build scalable applications, task queues. So why do

0:00:05.570,0:00:08.370
we need task queues? Well at this time this

0:00:08.370,0:00:11.080
picture should be no surprise to you. Our dear

0:00:11.080,0:00:15.500
users accessing our application from various devices. And our

0:00:15.500,0:00:19.330
application for turning the response. Technically this response must

0:00:19.330,0:00:22.390
be returned within 60 seconds from the request. But

0:00:22.390,0:00:25.340
that's a long time. We've talked about the importance

0:00:25.340,0:00:27.800
about returning a response as quickly as possible to

0:00:27.800,0:00:30.050
our dear users. And we don't want them to

0:00:30.050,0:00:33.260
wait, even for seconds, right? And certainly not 60

0:00:33.260,0:00:36.510
seconds. You want to deliver that response as quickly as

0:00:36.510,0:00:39.870
possible. But let's say that the user activity triggers

0:00:39.870,0:00:43.340
something big to happen. For example, the user adds a

0:00:43.340,0:00:46.720
new conference and as a consequence of that 10,000

0:00:46.720,0:00:50.510
emails should be sent out to notify other users about

0:00:50.510,0:00:53.650
this conference. First of all, that's not possible within

0:00:53.650,0:00:57.340
60 seconds. And secondly, you certainly don't want the

0:00:57.340,0:00:59.960
poor user that just registered the conference to wait

0:00:59.960,0:01:03.550
for this to happen. Remember, the screen update depends on

0:01:03.550,0:01:06.340
your response so even seconds are crucial to keep

0:01:06.340,0:01:09.790
your application responsive. Come to the rescue are task

0:01:09.790,0:01:13.510
queues. This is exactly the problem task queues solve.

0:01:13.510,0:01:15.590
And it may not be emails triggering the need for

0:01:15.590,0:01:18.700
this, it could be something else. For example, an

0:01:18.700,0:01:21.300
image needs to be analyzed or a video needs to

0:01:21.300,0:01:24.800
be re-encoded. Many things that are not needed to

0:01:24.800,0:01:27.840
complete the request for the user, could use task queues
