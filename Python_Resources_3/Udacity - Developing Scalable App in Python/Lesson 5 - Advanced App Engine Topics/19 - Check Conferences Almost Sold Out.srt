0:00:00.140,0:00:03.300
In this exercise,[br]you'll set up a cron job to periodically

0:00:03.300,0:00:06.950
update the announcement about[br]conferences that are almost sold out.

0:00:06.950,0:00:09.550
Since you've already written[br]the function to create the announcement,

0:00:09.550,0:00:12.790
pretty much all you're going to need[br]to do is to configure the cron job.

0:00:12.790,0:00:16.370
And you do that in a configuration[br]file called cron.yaml.

0:00:16.370,0:00:20.630
So you need to create a new file in your[br]project directory called cron.yaml, and

0:00:20.630,0:00:21.920
to find the cron job.

0:00:21.920,0:00:26.050
You need to provide the URL and[br]schedule, and option lay description.

0:00:26.050,0:00:28.970
The URL is the path to[br]the task to be run.

0:00:28.970,0:00:31.750
The description, which is optional,[br]describes the task so

0:00:31.750,0:00:33.735
you can figure out later what[br]your code was supposed to do.

0:00:33.735,0:00:36.995
And the schedule indicates[br]how often to run the task.

0:00:36.995,0:00:39.445
There are a variety of ways[br]to set the schedule, but

0:00:39.445,0:00:41.985
you must strictly follow the syntax or[br]the cron job won't run.

0:00:41.985,0:00:45.705
I recommend checking the format for[br]the schedule in the developer docks.

0:00:45.705,0:00:48.475
Note this says every 1 hours.

0:00:48.475,0:00:51.725
It would sound correct if you were[br]saying every 12 hours or every 2

0:00:51.725,0:00:56.500
hours but it turns out that even for 1,[br]you have to say every 1 hours, not hour.

0:00:56.500,0:01:01.370
You can see the defined cron jobs in the[br]cron job tab in the task queue section.

0:01:01.370,0:01:04.180
You can see the schedule, and[br]when it was last run, and

0:01:04.180,0:01:07.150
whether it was successful, and[br]you can also trigger to run it manually.

0:01:07.150,0:01:11.010
And now for your task in the exercise,[br]you should create the config file and

0:01:11.010,0:01:15.550
make it run, the /crons/set_announcement[br]URL every minute so

0:01:15.550,0:01:16.770
you can see it working.

0:01:16.770,0:01:19.920
But after you've tested your cron job,[br]you should set it to run much less

0:01:19.920,0:01:22.290
often, for example,[br]once every hour or two.

0:01:22.290,0:01:25.160
In general, you shouldn't run cron[br]jobs more often than necessary,

0:01:25.160,0:01:27.310
as they do consume resources and quota.

0:01:27.310,0:01:29.650
So after you complete each step here,[br]check it off.

0:01:29.650,0:01:32.610
Make sure, again, to change your[br]cron job from every minute to

0:01:32.610,0:01:34.710
every hour after you've seen it run.

0:01:34.710,0:01:38.380
And then, as a syntax check, how would[br]you schedule it to run every two hours?

0:01:38.380,0:01:39.190
Put that down here.
