Okay, let's look at the solution. What about optimized

0:00:03.220,0:00:06.480
app code? Well that's about making the code actually

0:00:06.480,0:00:09.760
run faster. App stats is the best option for

0:00:09.760,0:00:13.530
that. What about reduced latency for static content? Well doing

0:00:13.530,0:00:16.500
this would involve reducing the latency to the user.

0:00:16.500,0:00:19.980
A perfect example of edge caching. What about making your

0:00:19.980,0:00:22.830
app more responsive? Well, certainly queues could be an

0:00:22.830,0:00:25.460
option here to reduce the amount of time spent when

0:00:25.460,0:00:27.920
you process the request. But that could also

0:00:27.920,0:00:31.780
achieved using automatic scaling parameters, and of course mem

0:00:31.780,0:00:34.405
cache to serve content from memory instead of

0:00:34.405,0:00:38.990
datastore. What about reducing datastore reads? Well certainly, mem

0:00:38.990,0:00:41.750
cache would help out here, but edge caching

0:00:41.750,0:00:43.750
could also be an option if the content is

0:00:43.750,0:00:47.050
suitable for that. What about improving performance as

0:00:47.050,0:00:50.497
user base grows? Well, that's a clear cut scaling

0:00:50.497,0:00:55.320
out problem, so automatic scaling. All right, I hope you did well. And this quiz

0:00:55.320,0:00:59.480
has no exact answers. So be sure to discuss this in the forums as well.
