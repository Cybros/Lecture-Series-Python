0:00:00.190,0:00:02.530
Okay. So let's talk about another type of queue

0:00:02.530,0:00:05.460
called pull queues. This queue solves another kind of

0:00:05.460,0:00:08.380
problem. Let's say that you implemented a site that

0:00:08.380,0:00:11.810
requires humans to review comments. So the users of the

0:00:11.810,0:00:14.560
site generate comments and these comments need to be

0:00:14.560,0:00:18.200
reviewed before they are published. Similarly to push queues, you

0:00:18.200,0:00:21.640
could create a queue. And then insert comments to

0:00:21.640,0:00:25.700
be reviewed into this queue as tasks. And external people,

0:00:25.700,0:00:28.700
well in our case robots, could review the comments, perhaps

0:00:28.700,0:00:31.600
working from home in their spare time. So you have

0:00:31.600,0:00:35.110
your queue where you add comments as review tasks. Then

0:00:35.110,0:00:37.970
the different people would pull a review task from the queue

0:00:37.970,0:00:40.860
and work on it. So let's look at the difference

0:00:40.860,0:00:43.780
with push queues. Well in this case, App Engine is

0:00:43.780,0:00:47.380
not executing the tasks. They are instead executed by the

0:00:47.380,0:00:50.730
external workers. You can say that the task is pulled from

0:00:50.730,0:00:53.650
the queue by the external worker. That's why they are

0:00:53.650,0:00:57.950
called pull queues. The tasks that are pulled from the

0:00:57.950,0:01:01.360
queue are leased by the external workers. The worker must

0:01:01.360,0:01:04.250
complete the task within the lease time in which case it

0:01:04.250,0:01:07.130
can be deleted. But if the task is not completed

0:01:07.130,0:01:09.790
within the lease time, it is automatically returned to the

0:01:09.790,0:01:12.520
queue. If we compare a pull queues to push queues,

0:01:12.520,0:01:16.300
the differences are. So pull queues do not have a URL,

0:01:16.300,0:01:19.860
since your code is not completing the task. Each

0:01:19.860,0:01:22.100
task is leased by a worker for a certain

0:01:22.100,0:01:25.750
amount of time. A worker must delete the task

0:01:25.750,0:01:28.510
when it's completed, otherwise it is returned when the

0:01:28.510,0:01:32.400
lease expires. External workers pull the queue using a

0:01:32.400,0:01:35.540
REST interface. And there is no default queue for

0:01:35.540,0:01:38.840
pull queues, so you need to explicitly create them.

0:01:38.840,0:01:41.040
That's it for pull queues. Let's have a quiz.
