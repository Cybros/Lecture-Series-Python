Task queues allows you to take the job offline, so

0:00:03.450,0:00:05.750
you can create the task queue and then add a

0:00:05.750,0:00:08.580
hundred task that each has the job to send a

0:00:08.580,0:00:13.360
hundred emails. Tasks can be created for many user activity,

0:00:13.360,0:00:15.540
and be put on this queue. And as we will

0:00:15.540,0:00:18.690
see later, these tasks are not executed in the user

0:00:18.690,0:00:21.790
request strip. So you can immediately return a response to

0:00:21.790,0:00:25.490
the user, but one question remains then. How will these

0:00:25.490,0:00:30.670
mails be sent? That actually depends on the type of queue you use. But before we

0:00:30.670,0:00:35.210
go into that, it's time for you to answer a question. So the question is which

0:00:35.210,0:00:38.390
is best to use, the HTTP request thread

0:00:38.390,0:00:41.160
or task queues? When you want to generate

0:00:41.160,0:00:44.410
the report, or register a new user, checking

0:00:44.410,0:00:47.330
out the shopping cart, or do photo face recognition?
