0:00:00.440,0:00:02.830
We will now look at three App Engine success

0:00:02.830,0:00:06.210
stories that are representative, because they use the strengths

0:00:06.210,0:00:09.250
of App Engine. The first one is a real-time

0:00:09.250,0:00:13.310
earthquake monitoring system in japan. So in this picture, lots

0:00:13.310,0:00:15.680
of data is collected by NIED, which is an

0:00:15.680,0:00:18.810
institute in Japan. They look at the data and then

0:00:18.810,0:00:23.040
send image files to App Engine, every second. Clients

0:00:23.040,0:00:26.320
can then view these images files to see the activity.

0:00:26.320,0:00:28.830
Well, as you can imagine, when there is no earthquake

0:00:28.830,0:00:32.030
activity, there are not many clients that are interested in

0:00:32.030,0:00:35.210
watching this system. But on the other hand, when there

0:00:35.210,0:00:38.610
is earthquake activity, the system needs to serve a lot of

0:00:38.610,0:00:41.690
data to many clients. And this is, of course, a

0:00:41.690,0:00:44.440
great application for App Engine. Which can scale the number

0:00:44.440,0:00:47.820
of instances up and down, depending on the activity and

0:00:47.820,0:00:51.530
the number of clients accessing the system. Another great success story

0:00:51.530,0:00:54.140
of App Engine is Song Pop, an app you

0:00:54.140,0:00:56.330
may have used, which is a game where you guess

0:00:56.330,0:00:59.300
the song or an artist. Well, Song Pop grew

0:00:59.300,0:01:03.690
from zero to 10,000 queries per second in six months.

0:01:03.690,0:01:07.040
And as of early 2013, it had more than

0:01:07.040,0:01:10.970
60 million users. Song Pop uses app engine, again, because

0:01:10.970,0:01:13.930
of its ability to rapidly scale up and down based

0:01:13.930,0:01:16.880
on the user load. And one that you've certainly heard

0:01:16.880,0:01:20.910
about is Rovio, the creator of Angry Birds. When Rovio developed a web

0:01:20.910,0:01:22.800
based version of Angry Birds, they used

0:01:22.800,0:01:25.460
App Engine because of its automatic scaling.

0:01:25.460,0:01:29.470
But also for many of the other functions it provides. And these things

0:01:29.470,0:01:33.270
are exactly what you will learn when you take this course. So stay tuned.
