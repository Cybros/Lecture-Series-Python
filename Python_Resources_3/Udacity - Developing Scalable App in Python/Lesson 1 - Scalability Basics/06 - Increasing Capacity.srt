Let's see the answers. Buy more powerful

0:00:02.900,0:00:06.160
hardware. Yes. That could certainly help, but it

0:00:06.160,0:00:09.970
will not provide unlimited scalability. What about optimizing

0:00:09.970,0:00:13.590
the software? Yes. That could certainly also help.

0:00:13.590,0:00:17.270
But that, will not provide unlimited scalability either.

0:00:17.270,0:00:20.750
Copy and run software on more servers. Well,

0:00:20.750,0:00:23.230
normally, software cannot just be copied, and run

0:00:23.230,0:00:25.520
on more servers. To be able to run

0:00:25.520,0:00:27.590
on more servers, you typically have to change

0:00:27.590,0:00:31.200
the software, so this option is also an alternative.

0:00:31.200,0:00:33.240
In fact, if you can change your software to

0:00:33.240,0:00:35.610
run on more servers, you are starting to work

0:00:35.610,0:00:38.710
with the scalable architecture. This is because the capacity

0:00:38.710,0:00:41.380
will not be limited by the hardware you use,

0:00:41.380,0:00:44.090
or how much you can optimize your software. When

0:00:44.090,0:00:46.640
you need to scale, you can add more servers.
