Hi there.

0:00:01.500,0:00:03.670
>> Hi, and welcome to our[br]course on building scaleable

0:00:03.670,0:00:05.440
applications in Python.

0:00:05.440,0:00:08.200
>> My name is Magnus, and I work at[br]Google, with cloud technologies.

0:00:08.200,0:00:11.010
>> And I'm Karl,[br]I'm a course developer at Udacity.

0:00:11.010,0:00:14.290
>> Together we will teach you how[br]to build great applications that

0:00:14.290,0:00:15.980
run on Google infrastructure.

0:00:15.980,0:00:16.900
And that can scale.

0:00:16.900,0:00:17.630
>> And scale.

0:00:17.630,0:00:18.480
>> And scale.

0:00:18.480,0:00:19.190
>> And scale.

0:00:19.190,0:00:20.310
>> And scale.

0:00:20.310,0:00:23.620
>> Because at Google people really do[br]know how to build scalable systems.

0:00:23.620,0:00:26.790
>> That's right and after this[br]course you will also be able to

0:00:26.790,0:00:30.710
write scalable applications that[br]run in the Google data centers.

0:00:30.710,0:00:34.370
I will be teaching you the theory[br]behind building scalable applications.

0:00:34.370,0:00:36.790
>> And I'll be showing you how[br]to implement them in Python.

0:00:36.790,0:00:39.020
So with that why don't we get[br]right into our first lesson.
