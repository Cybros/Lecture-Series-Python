0:00:00.580,0:00:03.100
OK, so let's go through the solution. A news site

0:00:03.100,0:00:07.390
like New York Times, absolutely. It's an internet service, it

0:00:07.390,0:00:09.690
has lots of users and the load on the service

0:00:09.690,0:00:12.440
probably varies so the scaling of app engine could be used

0:00:12.440,0:00:16.320
a perfect match. What about a device driver testing system?

0:00:17.450,0:00:19.970
Well, it of course depends on what kind of system this

0:00:19.970,0:00:22.650
is but just the fact that device driver is part

0:00:22.650,0:00:25.610
of the title, make you think that it needs access to

0:00:25.610,0:00:29.540
low level resources within in a computer. Remember, app

0:00:29.540,0:00:32.780
engines are generic platform to build scalable applications and

0:00:32.780,0:00:35.120
from that perspective this does not sound like a

0:00:35.120,0:00:39.660
match. What about a personal portfolio site? Just because

0:00:39.660,0:00:41.980
it's a personal site and probably does not need

0:00:41.980,0:00:44.610
massive scale, does not mean that app engine can

0:00:44.610,0:00:47.700
not be of great use. App engine simplifies development

0:00:47.700,0:00:51.440
of server-side applications greatly, so this is a good match.

0:00:51.440,0:00:56.600
What about a video game? Well, if we just mean the user interface part then

0:00:56.600,0:00:58.700
app engine is not a good match, app

0:00:58.700,0:01:00.960
engine is used to develop server side applications.
