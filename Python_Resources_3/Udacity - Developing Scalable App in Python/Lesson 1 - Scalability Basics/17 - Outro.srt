Are you excited yet? We hope you are. We

0:00:03.010,0:00:05.140
think you should be. Just look at all of these

0:00:05.140,0:00:09.060
pictures of Google data centers. All the Google services run

0:00:09.060,0:00:11.680
on the infrastructure that you see. And with the Google

0:00:11.680,0:00:15.890
cloud platform and app engine, this infrastructure is also available

0:00:15.890,0:00:19.030
to you. That means that the code you create in

0:00:19.030,0:00:22.300
this course will execute alongside all of the other Google

0:00:22.300,0:00:25.950
services. And can leverage from the same scale security and

0:00:25.950,0:00:30.090
performance that Google has built out over the years. We

0:00:30.090,0:00:32.830
can't wait to get started and have you on your way

0:00:32.830,0:00:36.130
to write and deploy your own code into these data centers

0:00:36.130,0:00:40.650
on your journey to writing scalable applications in the Google Cloud.
