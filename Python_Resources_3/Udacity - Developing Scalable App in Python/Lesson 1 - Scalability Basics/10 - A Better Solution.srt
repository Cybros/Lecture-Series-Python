0:00:00.290,0:00:02.950
So let's look at a better solution. Because this

0:00:02.950,0:00:05.689
should not be a problem that every single developer of

0:00:05.689,0:00:09.810
server side applications need to think about. Fortunately the Google

0:00:09.810,0:00:12.600
cloud platform has a product that takes care of most

0:00:12.600,0:00:16.050
of these things. It's called App Engine, and that's

0:00:16.050,0:00:18.280
what we will be using in this course. Let's take

0:00:18.280,0:00:22.090
a closer look. App Engine is a development and deployment

0:00:22.090,0:00:25.700
platform that takes care of many things for your application.

0:00:25.700,0:00:28.540
For example, it performs all the scaling for you

0:00:28.540,0:00:32.896
automatically. So when your application runs on App Engine, and

0:00:32.896,0:00:35.797
there is more traffic it needs to manage. Then

0:00:35.797,0:00:38.511
App Engine will increase the number of instances to use

0:00:38.511,0:00:41.100
to take care of the load. This is called

0:00:41.100,0:00:44.590
scaling up. And at other times, when your application is

0:00:44.590,0:00:47.340
not so busy. App Engine will reduce the number

0:00:47.340,0:00:50.930
of instances to save resources and cost. This is called

0:00:50.930,0:00:54.800
scaling down. And this scaling is done automatically. You

0:00:54.800,0:00:57.600
don't need to write a single line of application code

0:00:57.600,0:01:00.910
to get this benefit. And it doesn't stop with automatic

0:01:00.910,0:01:04.550
scaling. The App Engine platform has functionality to deal with

0:01:04.550,0:01:07.300
all of the things we've previously looked at. So there

0:01:07.300,0:01:09.800
is no need for you to do any design or

0:01:09.800,0:01:13.540
coding to deal with that. And this is no coincidence.

0:01:13.540,0:01:16.600
Google has been the leader in designing scalable systems and

0:01:16.600,0:01:19.460
all that experience was built into App Engine

0:01:19.460,0:01:22.550
when it was designed. As is everything runs on

0:01:22.550,0:01:25.760
Google infrastructure. There are Google engineers watching over

0:01:25.760,0:01:28.890
these systems day and night, to make sure everything

0:01:28.890,0:01:32.220
is running smoothly. So that you, can focus

0:01:32.220,0:01:35.870
on your application. In Cloud language, App Engine is

0:01:35.870,0:01:38.790
classified as a PaaS solution. And this makes

0:01:38.790,0:01:41.840
sense, because App Engine is a platform that takes

0:01:41.840,0:01:45.260
care of a lot of the complexity of building scalable applications
