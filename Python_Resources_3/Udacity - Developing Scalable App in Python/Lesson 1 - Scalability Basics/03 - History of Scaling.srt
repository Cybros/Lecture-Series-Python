We're out here by the Computer History Museum

0:00:02.450,0:00:05.340
in Mountain View, California. The Google headquarters is

0:00:05.340,0:00:07.700
just around the corner. But before we start

0:00:07.700,0:00:10.830
to build our applications on the Google cloud platform,

0:00:10.830,0:00:13.030
let's look at the history of building server

0:00:13.030,0:00:17.740
side applications. Fifty years ago this is where

0:00:17.740,0:00:21.140
most server-side applications were born. On a physical

0:00:21.140,0:00:25.530
computer sitting under the desk in some office. Yeah,

0:00:25.530,0:00:29.080
seriously. A physical computer, you know, one that

0:00:29.080,0:00:34.230
you can touch and smell. And the generated

0:00:34.230,0:00:36.590
heat from the fan outlet, so you could

0:00:36.590,0:00:39.830
warm your feet, if the office was cold. Well,

0:00:39.830,0:00:42.310
it didn't take long until the server-side applications

0:00:42.310,0:00:44.640
grew bigger. And it was no longer possible

0:00:44.640,0:00:47.080
to run them on a computer like this.

0:00:47.080,0:00:50.690
So the pizza box computer was created because it

0:00:50.690,0:00:53.650
looked like a pizza box. And these were great

0:00:53.650,0:00:56.140
because you could stack them on top of each other

0:00:59.160,0:01:03.130
and on top of each other and on top of each other. And voila! The

0:01:03.130,0:01:08.630
computer rack had just been born. And the entire shebang was put in a dedicated

0:01:08.630,0:01:13.100
room called the data center, because all the fans made too much noise and stuff.

0:01:14.100,0:01:15.890
But it was no longer possible to warm

0:01:15.890,0:01:17.920
your feet against the fan outlet of course.
