0:00:00.270,0:00:02.270
Okay. So by now, you've heard a lot of

0:00:02.270,0:00:05.330
positive things about App Engine and how it can help

0:00:05.330,0:00:08.850
you build scalable applications. But let's do a reality check

0:00:08.850,0:00:11.880
here. Surely, there must also be trade offs involved when

0:00:11.880,0:00:16.120
using App Engine. Let's start off with programming languages.

0:00:16.120,0:00:19.560
Since App Engine provides services to control the execution environment,

0:00:19.560,0:00:22.830
it also has to set up programming languages it supports.

0:00:22.830,0:00:25.350
This list has been extended over time, but App Engine

0:00:25.350,0:00:29.780
currently supports Python, Java, PHP, and Go.

0:00:29.780,0:00:33.780
And since App Engine is an execution container,

0:00:33.780,0:00:35.780
it also means that there are specific versions

0:00:35.780,0:00:38.130
of these languages that are supported, so this

0:00:38.130,0:00:40.960
is something to think about. Then moving over

0:00:40.960,0:00:44.120
to low-level controls. Since App Engine was designed

0:00:44.120,0:00:46.980
to create scalable application as easy as possible,

0:00:46.980,0:00:51.400
it's execution environment also encapsulate many low-level controls.

0:00:51.400,0:00:54.990
For example, operating system type and version, virtual

0:00:54.990,0:00:58.370
machine configuration, or network controls, et cetera are not

0:00:58.370,0:01:01.780
visible, and cannot be configured in App Engine. And

0:01:01.780,0:01:04.640
that goes for other things, as well. App Engine

0:01:04.640,0:01:08.020
strikes a great balance between providing the convenience you

0:01:08.020,0:01:12.210
need to develop scalable applications without sacrificing the flexibility

0:01:12.210,0:01:14.820
that you want. But with this in mind, don't

0:01:14.820,0:01:16.980
be surprised later on when you see App Engine

0:01:16.980,0:01:21.540
is not like a regular virtual machine, because it's not. All right. That's

0:01:21.540,0:01:25.040
it for the reality check. Let's now look at some App Engine success stories.
