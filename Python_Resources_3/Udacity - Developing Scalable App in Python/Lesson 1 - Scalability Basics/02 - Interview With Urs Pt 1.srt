0:00:00.860,0:00:03.400
So we're sitting here with Urs HÃ¶lzle, Senior

0:00:03.400,0:00:07.220
Vice President of Infrastructure here at Google. Urs, could

0:00:07.220,0:00:09.580
you briefly describe your role here at Google

0:00:09.580,0:00:13.510
and why Google has all of these data centers?

0:00:13.510,0:00:16.219
>> I am responsible for technical infrastructure at Google

0:00:16.219,0:00:18.370
and that's the team that builds all the data

0:00:18.370,0:00:23.250
centers, network servers, software systems that runs our internal

0:00:23.250,0:00:26.490
cloud and we built that a long time ago

0:00:26.490,0:00:28.220
for our own needs. And we have very large

0:00:28.220,0:00:31.820
scale applications and so we needed a very capable cloud.

0:00:31.820,0:00:35.130
And now we're making that cloud available to everyone

0:00:35.130,0:00:40.070
through App Engine, Compute Engine, and our Cloud Platform overall.

0:00:40.070,0:00:43.358
>> Urs, so what excites you about Google Cloud Platform and

0:00:43.358,0:00:47.570
App Engine in particular, which is the focus of this course?

0:00:47.570,0:00:49.392
>> What's great about the Google Cloud Platform

0:00:49.392,0:00:52.060
is, is really, one, that we can make our

0:00:52.060,0:00:56.430
great internal infrastructure accessible to every developer out there.

0:00:56.430,0:00:59.170
And then, in the Cloud Platform, App Engine is

0:00:59.170,0:01:02.220
really the, that, that one system that makes it

0:01:02.220,0:01:05.379
really easier for you to start very small. And then

0:01:05.379,0:01:09.560
scale to a very large user base. So that

0:01:09.560,0:01:11.990
if you have a game that suddenly becomes popular,

0:01:11.990,0:01:14.970
our back-end and our front-end is going to scale with

0:01:14.970,0:01:17.190
you. And you don't really have to change your application

0:01:17.190,0:01:20.080
very much. And that's rare to see in infrastructure. Usually

0:01:20.080,0:01:22.310
you have to do the hard work up front. Now, with

0:01:22.310,0:01:24.440
App Engine, you kind of don't really have to do the

0:01:24.440,0:01:26.660
hard work at all because we can do it for you.
