Okay, let's continue our story on the history of

0:00:02.670,0:00:06.740
server side computing. At this time we enter the race

0:00:06.740,0:00:10.530
for scalability. Because once the computer rack was created,

0:00:10.530,0:00:12.610
we could start to stack servers on top of each

0:00:12.610,0:00:15.150
other to save space. And this was of course

0:00:15.150,0:00:19.960
great. But now, another problem surfaced. Because even though these

0:00:19.960,0:00:22.500
servers were great from a stacking perspective, it was

0:00:22.500,0:00:25.290
still the case that one application could only run on

0:00:25.290,0:00:28.489
one server. And this became a big problem,

0:00:28.489,0:00:31.921
because as the internet grew, these applications got

0:00:31.921,0:00:34.326
more and more popular. And more and more

0:00:34.326,0:00:39.230
popular. And more and more popular! And since

0:00:39.230,0:00:40.790
there is a limit to the performance of

0:00:40.790,0:00:44.250
one server, this architecture was not sustainable and

0:00:44.250,0:00:47.320
had to be abandoned. The one application, one

0:00:47.320,0:00:51.170
server strategy was a dead end street and

0:00:51.170,0:00:53.260
a radically new solution was required
