0:00:00.170,0:00:01.780
All right.[br]So, the first filter that we want to

0:00:01.780,0:00:05.010
apply is: the conference[br]is taking place in Tokyo,

0:00:05.010,0:00:09.910
which is to say, conference.city,[br]double equals, string Tokyo.

0:00:09.910,0:00:12.110
Then, if we want one to[br]nine seats available,

0:00:12.110,0:00:14.980
that means we want greater than zero and[br]less than ten.

0:00:14.980,0:00:19.160
You could also use greater than or equal[br]to one, or less than or equal to nine,

0:00:19.160,0:00:21.470
if you want, but[br]this is pretty straightforward.

0:00:21.470,0:00:23.460
Then we have three order by conditions.

0:00:23.460,0:00:26.790
First we want to order by seats[br]available, then by name, and

0:00:26.790,0:00:27.980
finally by month.

0:00:27.980,0:00:31.000
And there we go, all on one line, or[br]seven, depending on how you count.
