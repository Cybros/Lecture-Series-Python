Okay, that's a good introduction to indexes, but there is more and

0:00:04.560,0:00:09.430
in the section we will cover composite indexes. Remember the single property

0:00:09.430,0:00:14.790
index we looked at, that had the city as to value. A single property index is

0:00:14.790,0:00:20.440
also called a built-in index. Data store can in many cases combine results

0:00:20.440,0:00:25.830
from different built in indexes to provide a response to a query, but there

0:00:25.830,0:00:30.580
are cases where this is not possible. That's when we need a composite index.

0:00:31.750,0:00:35.740
In fact we have already used composite indexes in conference central for

0:00:35.740,0:00:40.780
this query. Retrieve all conferences, filter by city and topic. And

0:00:40.780,0:00:46.690
sort by name. This is a composite index, because the built in indexes for city,

0:00:46.690,0:00:52.950
topic, and name, cannot be combined to generate the result. For this to work,

0:00:52.950,0:00:57.550
an index table consisting of multiple values and combination must be created.

0:00:57.550,0:01:02.810
This is exactly what a composite index is. So how are composite indexes built?

0:01:02.810,0:01:09.510
There are two different ways. The first way is to add an index to an index file.

0:01:09.510,0:01:12.440
[UNKNOWN] a little bit differently depending on which language you use, so

0:01:12.440,0:01:17.030
you will see how to do this in one of the exercises. The other way is to

0:01:17.030,0:01:21.800
actually run your application locally on your development server. In this case,

0:01:21.800,0:01:25.520
if App Engine encounters a query that requires the composite index,

0:01:25.520,0:01:27.870
it will automatically update the index file.

0:01:27.870,0:01:32.170
When you later deploy App Engine, this index file will be uploaded as well.

0:01:32.170,0:01:36.980
So it will also exist when executing on App Engine. All right, it's time for

0:01:36.980,0:01:39.530
an exercise where you will explore composite indexes
