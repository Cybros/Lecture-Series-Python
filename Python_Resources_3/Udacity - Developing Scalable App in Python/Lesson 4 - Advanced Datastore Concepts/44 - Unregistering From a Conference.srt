So there's still one more feature[br]that you could add to the project

0:00:02.770,0:00:06.060
to round out the functionality[br]around registering for a conference.

0:00:06.060,0:00:09.320
One obvious gap is that[br]currently there's no way to

0:00:09.320,0:00:11.360
unregister from a conference.

0:00:11.360,0:00:13.420
Feel free to add the end points method,

0:00:13.420,0:00:16.040
unregister from conference if you're so[br]inclined.

0:00:16.040,0:00:18.390
Take a look at the conference[br]registration function.
