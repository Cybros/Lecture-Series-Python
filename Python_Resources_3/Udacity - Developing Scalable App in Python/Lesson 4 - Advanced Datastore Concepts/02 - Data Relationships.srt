Let's start off by looking at two important

0:00:02.480,0:00:04.750
data relationships when you do modeling in data

0:00:04.750,0:00:10.480
store. They are ancestor relationships and has-a relationships.

0:00:10.480,0:00:13.960
Starting off with the ancestor relationship in data store

0:00:13.960,0:00:16.190
it is possible to specify that an entity

0:00:16.190,0:00:19.970
has an ancestor entity. There are two important

0:00:19.970,0:00:23.180
rules for ancestor relationships. First of all, it

0:00:23.180,0:00:25.620
needs to be assigned when the entity is created.

0:00:26.750,0:00:29.860
And secondly it can never be changed so

0:00:29.860,0:00:32.060
those are things to think about when you model

0:00:32.060,0:00:35.960
an ancestor relationship. And given those rules, please note

0:00:35.960,0:00:38.860
that the ancestor relationship is not the same as

0:00:38.860,0:00:42.900
the is-a relationship in object oriented modeling. In conference

0:00:42.900,0:00:45.790
central, we will use the ancestor relationship for the

0:00:45.790,0:00:49.130
conference kind that you will create shortly. Where the

0:00:49.130,0:00:53.030
ancestor will be the user who created the conference.

0:00:53.030,0:00:56.270
Technically speaking though since the users are identified

0:00:56.270,0:00:59.720
through their profile entities, so in this case the

0:00:59.720,0:01:01.740
conferences will have the key of the profile

0:01:01.740,0:01:06.120
entity as their ancestor key. The other relationship we

0:01:06.120,0:01:09.770
will be using is the has-a relationship. We

0:01:09.770,0:01:13.020
will be using this relationship to model conferences which

0:01:13.020,0:01:15.560
users are attending. To do this we will

0:01:15.560,0:01:18.460
add a property to the profile entity which specifies

0:01:18.460,0:01:22.150
the attended conferences. So each profile will have

0:01:22.150,0:01:24.970
a property that contains the conferences that they are

0:01:24.970,0:01:29.128
attending, observe that this relationship can easily change.

0:01:29.128,0:01:32.040
We can deregister from conferences and register to new

0:01:32.040,0:01:34.000
ones, so it is not bounded by the

0:01:34.000,0:01:37.570
strict rules of the ancestor relationship. So those are

0:01:37.570,0:01:40.010
the basics of these relationships and that's also

0:01:40.010,0:01:42.330
enough theory for now. Time to do some coding.
