So to answer that question let's[br]take a look at our log files.

0:00:03.210,0:00:06.840
I have here a bad request error: the[br]first sort property must be the same as

0:00:06.840,0:00:09.570
the property in which[br]the inequality filter is applied.

0:00:09.570,0:00:11.540
In your query,[br]the first sort property is name,

0:00:11.540,0:00:14.260
but the inequality filter[br]is on max attendees.

0:00:14.260,0:00:15.740
So that means that this[br]is the correct answer.
