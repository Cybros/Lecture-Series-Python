Run your app on local host and

0:00:02.029,0:00:05.230
then use the API's explorer[br]to create a conference.

0:00:05.230,0:00:08.530
And then go to the Admin console to[br]check that the conference was created

0:00:08.530,0:00:09.710
as expected.

0:00:09.710,0:00:13.190
You can also use the create conference[br]page in the app to create and

0:00:13.190,0:00:14.350
save a conference.

0:00:14.350,0:00:17.010
The conference will be created[br]because the conference page sends

0:00:17.010,0:00:20.120
a call to the Save Conference function[br]which you've now implemented.

0:00:20.120,0:00:22.290
But the Show Conferences[br]page will not yet

0:00:22.290,0:00:25.305
work because you have not yet[br]implemented the function that it calls,

0:00:25.305,0:00:28.310
the functions to query[br]an output conference records.

0:00:28.310,0:00:31.700
So no matter whether you create your[br]conference in the API's explorer or

0:00:31.700,0:00:34.800
in the Create Conference page, you'll[br]need to use the data store viewer and

0:00:34.800,0:00:37.140
the Admin console to check that[br]the conference got created.
