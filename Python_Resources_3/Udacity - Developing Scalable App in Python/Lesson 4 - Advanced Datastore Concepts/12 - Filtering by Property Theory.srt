0:00:00.350,0:00:02.668
All right, I hope that went well. We

0:00:02.668,0:00:05.560
will now talk about the most flexible query mechanism

0:00:05.560,0:00:11.010
in Datastore. Query by kind, filter by property. Let's

0:00:11.010,0:00:13.400
say you would like to query for all conferences

0:00:13.400,0:00:15.600
that are in a particular city, for example

0:00:15.600,0:00:19.620
Halloween, and with a specific topic like movie making,

0:00:19.620,0:00:22.080
and then sort the matching entries by conference name.

0:00:23.080,0:00:25.360
For example, if we were to write this out

0:00:25.360,0:00:28.620
it could look like this. Retrieve all conferences that

0:00:28.620,0:00:31.990
are in the city Halloween, and has moving making

0:00:31.990,0:00:36.180
in the topic. Sort the result by name. This

0:00:36.180,0:00:39.650
is an example of query by kind, filter by property,

0:00:39.650,0:00:42.060
since we are using property values in the search

0:00:42.060,0:00:44.810
and the sort. Let's look at this a little

0:00:44.810,0:00:47.760
bit closer. We want to have an exact match

0:00:47.760,0:00:50.625
for the city since we are only interested in conferences

0:00:50.625,0:00:53.930
in Halloween. This is called an equality filter.

0:00:55.040,0:00:57.210
Then, we want to further restrict the queries

0:00:57.210,0:00:59.960
so that only entities which has movie making

0:00:59.960,0:01:03.510
in the topic are displayed. This is called a

0:01:03.510,0:01:06.900
member of filter. We are combining these with

0:01:06.900,0:01:09.820
the and operator, meaning that both of these conditions

0:01:09.820,0:01:12.800
must be true. And finally, we are sorting

0:01:12.800,0:01:16.030
the result by name. Let's look at filters and

0:01:16.030,0:01:18.100
how you can use them to construct a query in

0:01:18.100,0:01:21.950
more detail. The first filter is the equality filter, that

0:01:21.950,0:01:25.020
we used for city in our example. Then, we have

0:01:25.020,0:01:27.640
the member of filter, which has the same symbol as

0:01:27.640,0:01:30.530
the equality filter. This filter, we use to sort by

0:01:30.530,0:01:34.100
topic. Then we have a set of inequality filters, not

0:01:34.100,0:01:37.870
equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater

0:01:37.870,0:01:41.100
than, greater than or equal to. And all of these can

0:01:41.100,0:01:44.470
be combined using the Boolean operators and, and

0:01:44.470,0:01:47.860
or. That's enough theory to get started. So

0:01:47.860,0:01:49.910
now it's time for you to add query

0:01:49.910,0:01:52.800
by kind, filter by property, to conference central.
