Okay, so not a very big change there.

0:00:02.660,0:00:04.510
But if you deploy this, wait for

0:00:04.510,0:00:09.460
it to deploy, then go to your app and[br]add a filter, hit Search, and it works.

0:00:09.460,0:00:12.550
Now, if you happen to notice[br]that a particular filter or

0:00:12.550,0:00:16.610
combination of filters yields an error,[br]well take a look in your logs, and

0:00:16.610,0:00:19.920
you might see something familiar[br]from a previous part of the lesson.

0:00:19.920,0:00:21.960
And you can fix that in the way[br]that we discussed earlier.
