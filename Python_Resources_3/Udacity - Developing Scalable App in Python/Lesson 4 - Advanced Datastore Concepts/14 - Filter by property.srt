0:00:00.330,0:00:02.020
So here is one possible solution.

0:00:02.020,0:00:05.320
We have the filterPlayground method,[br]which is exposed to the API

0:00:05.320,0:00:09.350
with the request type of VoidMessage,[br]response type of ConferenceForms.

0:00:09.350,0:00:13.570
Starts out by building an empty query,[br]then filters the query by city equals

0:00:13.570,0:00:17.310
London, then by Conference.topics[br]equals Medical Innovations.

0:00:17.310,0:00:18.820
Let's just sort it by conference name,

0:00:18.820,0:00:20.540
because that makes it[br]a little bit neater.

0:00:20.540,0:00:23.040
And then return,[br]the ConferenceForms object,

0:00:23.040,0:00:25.330
which is a copy of each[br]conference returned by the query.
