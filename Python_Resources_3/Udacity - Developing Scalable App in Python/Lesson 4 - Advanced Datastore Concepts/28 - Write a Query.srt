So you probably noticed in the[br]Conference Central code that as we build

0:00:03.481,0:00:07.383
up a query with filters, we've been[br]re-assigning the variable q like this.

0:00:07.383,0:00:09.125
But there's a somewhat[br]neater way to do this.

0:00:09.125,0:00:13.513
Every one of these filter and order[br]methods returns an updated query object.

0:00:13.513,0:00:16.312
That means we can just use[br]method chaining, like this.

0:00:16.312,0:00:19.390
We can compose a complex query[br]all on one line of code, or

0:00:19.390,0:00:23.069
a few lines of code with backslashes[br]as continuation characters.

0:00:23.069,0:00:27.441
So how would you write a query to filter[br]for conferences in Tokyo with at least

0:00:27.441,0:00:32.220
one, but less than ten seats available,[br]sorted by the number of seats available,

0:00:32.220,0:00:35.247
then by the conference name,[br]and then by the month?

0:00:35.247,0:00:36.640
Fill in the query here in Python.
