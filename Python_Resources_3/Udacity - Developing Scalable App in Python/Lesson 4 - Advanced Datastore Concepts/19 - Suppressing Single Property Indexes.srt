0:00:00.290,0:00:01.830
So if we look through the documentation,

0:00:01.830,0:00:04.590
we'll see that StringProperty[br]is indexed by default.

0:00:04.590,0:00:06.140
TextProperty is not.

0:00:06.140,0:00:07.860
DateTimeProperty is.

0:00:07.860,0:00:10.810
BlobProperty is not, and[br]JsonProperty is not.

0:00:10.810,0:00:12.970
The only tricky one here[br]is DateTimeProperty,

0:00:12.970,0:00:16.129
where it doesn't explicitly say in[br]the docs if it's indexed or not.

0:00:16.129,0:00:18.620
But since the default[br]behavior is indexed for all,

0:00:18.620,0:00:20.170
we can assume it's indexed.

0:00:20.170,0:00:21.990
You can also look at your datastore and

0:00:21.990,0:00:24.479
see that you have Date/Time[br]values with an index.
