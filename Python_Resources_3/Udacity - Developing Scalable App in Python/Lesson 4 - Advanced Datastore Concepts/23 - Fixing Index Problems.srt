0:00:00.120,0:00:03.860
So here's this error that we've received[br]from running our filterPlayground query.

0:00:03.860,0:00:06.370
We've gotten this 503[br]Internal Server Error.

0:00:06.370,0:00:08.000
That's not very informative.

0:00:08.000,0:00:11.330
We go over to the Developer's Consule,[br]though, and look under monitoring and

0:00:11.330,0:00:14.115
logs, we can see a request to

0:00:14.115,0:00:17.920
ConferenceApi.filterPlayground returning[br]an error.

0:00:17.920,0:00:21.560
And if we take a look into that error,[br]we'll see it says here,

0:00:21.560,0:00:24.650
raised NeedIndexError (no[br]matching index found.

0:00:24.650,0:00:28.226
The suggested index for this query is,[br]and then it has kind: Conference,

0:00:28.226,0:00:30.780
properties: city,[br]month, topics and name.

0:00:30.780,0:00:33.820
So normally when test[br]the app on localHost,

0:00:33.820,0:00:35.540
indexes get autogenerated, and

0:00:35.540,0:00:39.960
they land in a file called index.yaml[br]which shows up in your source directory.

0:00:39.960,0:00:40.750
As you can see,

0:00:40.750,0:00:43.780
there's a previous index from[br]a simpler version of this query here.

0:00:43.780,0:00:46.690
But you can also specifically[br]define composite indexes for

0:00:46.690,0:00:48.150
all queries that you will run.

0:00:48.150,0:00:50.280
So knowing what you now[br]know about indexes,

0:00:50.280,0:00:52.470
which of the following[br]statements are true?

0:00:52.470,0:00:53.070
How can you make

0:00:53.070,0:00:55.840
sure that you will have all of[br]the indexes that your queries will need?

0:00:55.840,0:00:58.350
Could you manually edit[br]the index configuration?

0:00:58.350,0:01:01.920
Run every multi-property query on[br]localhost before you deploy to appspot?

0:01:01.920,0:01:04.940
Mark all properties you need[br]indexed with index equals True.

0:01:04.940,0:01:07.430
Or for single property indexes,[br]you don't need to do anything.
