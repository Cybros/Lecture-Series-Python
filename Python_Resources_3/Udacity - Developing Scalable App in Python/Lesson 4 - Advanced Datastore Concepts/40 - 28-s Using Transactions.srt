0:00:00.210,0:00:03.250
So in this case you have to use[br]the cross group transaction

0:00:03.250,0:00:06.620
because the function is changing two[br]different kinds of entities, profile and

0:00:06.620,0:00:07.420
conference.

0:00:07.420,0:00:10.890
Although for the conference owner those[br]two entities who belong to the same

0:00:10.890,0:00:13.810
group because the profile is[br]ancestor for a conference.

0:00:13.810,0:00:16.670
That's only the case for[br]the user who created the conference.

0:00:16.670,0:00:20.110
For any other user, the profile entity[br]and the conference entity are not

0:00:20.110,0:00:23.680
related by ancestral relationship and[br]therefore they belong to two different

0:00:23.680,0:00:26.870
entity groups and that's why[br]you need to use xg equals true.
