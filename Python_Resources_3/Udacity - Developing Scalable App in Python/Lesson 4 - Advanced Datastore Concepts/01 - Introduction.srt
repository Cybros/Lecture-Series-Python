Hi, and welcome to lesson four. Conference central is

0:00:04.290,0:00:07.510
starting to look like an interesting application. In addition to

0:00:07.510,0:00:10.090
user management that we introduced in lesson two, we

0:00:10.090,0:00:13.980
also added data store in lesson three. Now it's time

0:00:13.980,0:00:17.060
to look at data relationships and how to retrieve

0:00:17.060,0:00:20.760
data and make no mistake about it. There's a lot

0:00:20.760,0:00:23.110
of moving parts with respect to this. So you

0:00:23.110,0:00:26.021
better keep your eye on the ball. [SOUND] In addition

0:00:26.021,0:00:32.159
to data relationships and queries, we will be looking at datastore

0:00:32.159,0:00:38.561
consistency rules and transactions in this lesson. Now is probably a good time

0:00:38.561,0:00:42.839
to seriously start to checkout the documentation on the internet as well

0:00:42.839,0:00:44.592
to become a master of building

0:00:44.592,0:00:47.720
scalable applications. Let's get started, shall we?
