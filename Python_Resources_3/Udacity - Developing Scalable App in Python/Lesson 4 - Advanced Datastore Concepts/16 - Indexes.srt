0:00:00.250,0:00:03.270
All data store queries are performed using indexes,

0:00:03.270,0:00:05.520
and knowing how they work is important when you

0:00:05.520,0:00:08.340
design and build your applications. If you have

0:00:08.340,0:00:11.550
worked with a relational database management system, and SQL.

0:00:11.550,0:00:13.870
You should be aware that those indexes are

0:00:13.870,0:00:17.330
not the same as data store indexes. Indexes in

0:00:17.330,0:00:20.740
RDBMS are a query optimization used to retrieve your

0:00:20.740,0:00:24.740
result faster. While indexes in Datastore are, in fact,

0:00:24.740,0:00:30.580
required to perform a query on that data at all. So you if you want to query for

0:00:30.580,0:00:33.080
Datastore data, there has to be an index for

0:00:33.080,0:00:36.740
that data. Be sure to remember this. So let's

0:00:36.740,0:00:39.870
look at Datastore indexes by going back to conferences.

0:00:39.870,0:00:41.680
And look at what happens when we perform a

0:00:41.680,0:00:45.440
search on the property city. In fact, let's even

0:00:45.440,0:00:49.950
talk about what happens before the query. When storing entities,

0:00:49.950,0:00:52.810
Datastore also updates index tables, which are

0:00:52.810,0:00:55.140
later used to find entities when the query

0:00:55.140,0:00:58.280
is made. These index tables consist of an

0:00:58.280,0:01:00.790
index value, that maps to a matching entity

0:01:00.790,0:01:04.450
key. Taking the city Berlin as an example,

0:01:04.450,0:01:07.033
the index value would be constructed using the

0:01:07.033,0:01:10.801
kind, conference. Then the property, city, and finally

0:01:10.801,0:01:15.030
the value of the property, Berlin. Here are

0:01:15.030,0:01:17.680
the index values for the cities Halloween,

0:01:17.680,0:01:21.590
London, and Paris. So again, the index value

0:01:21.590,0:01:24.600
is a combination of the kind, property, and

0:01:24.600,0:01:28.030
value of the property. Each index value then

0:01:28.030,0:01:30.010
points to the entity key where the value

0:01:30.010,0:01:34.150
resides. So a matching entity where city is

0:01:34.150,0:01:37.570
Berlin has the following key. And one with

0:01:37.570,0:01:39.920
London has the following key, and so on.

0:01:41.130,0:01:44.880
So let's say your favorite city is, Paris.

0:01:44.880,0:01:47.040
And you would like to get all conferences that

0:01:47.040,0:01:50.030
are in Paris. Then Datastore would look at the

0:01:50.030,0:01:53.160
index table where city is Paris, and find all

0:01:53.160,0:01:57.140
matching entities. Since data store require index tables

0:01:57.140,0:02:00.350
to perform queries, every property that you query for

0:02:00.350,0:02:03.624
will need an index table. By default, Datastore creates

0:02:03.624,0:02:06.310
these automatically. But we will also see how you

0:02:06.310,0:02:07.510
can control this later on.
