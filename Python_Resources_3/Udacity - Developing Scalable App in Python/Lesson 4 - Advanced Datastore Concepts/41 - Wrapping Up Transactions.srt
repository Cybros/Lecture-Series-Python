Okay, the time has come to wrap up

0:00:02.070,0:00:05.560
transactions where we will cover transaction rules. And the

0:00:05.560,0:00:07.910
two things we will start with are snapshot

0:00:07.910,0:00:13.050
isolation which defines the read consistency and optimistic concurrency

0:00:13.050,0:00:16.210
which governs concurrent updates. We'll start off with

0:00:16.210,0:00:20.070
snapshot isolation. And please observe that this behavior may

0:00:20.070,0:00:22.570
differ between languages, so be sure to check out

0:00:22.570,0:00:25.480
the documentation. The first rule is that all read

0:00:25.480,0:00:29.040
operations in a transaction will return the values datastore

0:00:29.040,0:00:32.280
had when the transaction started. And the second rule

0:00:32.280,0:00:35.960
for snapshot isolation is. Updates will not be reflected

0:00:35.960,0:00:39.070
while in the transaction. So, if an entity is modified

0:00:39.070,0:00:41.780
or deleted in the transaction, a query will get

0:00:41.780,0:00:44.750
the original version of the entity, or nothing if

0:00:44.750,0:00:48.300
the entity did not exit then. That's snapshot isolation,

0:00:48.300,0:00:50.920
but please be sure to check out the documentation as

0:00:50.920,0:00:54.360
this behavior is somewhat language specific. So let's

0:00:54.360,0:00:57.880
turn to optimistic concurrency. This rule is that a

0:00:57.880,0:01:00.990
commit transaction would only be successful if the

0:01:00.990,0:01:04.810
values updated by this transaction have not changed since

0:01:04.810,0:01:07.650
the begin transaction. If the values that you're

0:01:07.650,0:01:11.030
trying to update has changed since begin, the transaction

0:01:11.030,0:01:13.460
will fail. Then there are two additional rules

0:01:13.460,0:01:15.990
you should be aware of. The first is that

0:01:15.990,0:01:18.750
one transaction can modify at most five ancestor

0:01:18.750,0:01:21.590
groups. The second rule is that a transaction

0:01:21.590,0:01:24.680
must complete within 60 seconds, but the general

0:01:24.680,0:01:26.710
rule is, of course, to keep the execution

0:01:26.710,0:01:30.200
of transactions short. As short as possible, unless

0:01:30.200,0:01:32.840
in extremely rare cases, they should be finished

0:01:32.840,0:01:34.740
within a couple of seconds and in most

0:01:34.740,0:01:38.050
cases, less than a second. That completes this section
