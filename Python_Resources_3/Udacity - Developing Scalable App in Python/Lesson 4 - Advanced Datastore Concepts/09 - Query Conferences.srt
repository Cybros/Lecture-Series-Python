Okay, so here we go.

0:00:00.979,0:00:04.885
We're looping over all the conferences[br]returned from a conference query with

0:00:04.885,0:00:08.386
no filters, putting them in[br]ConferenceForms, and returning that.

0:00:08.386,0:00:09.245
So this works fine.

0:00:09.245,0:00:11.459
And now we can go ahead and[br]add some more queries,

0:00:11.459,0:00:13.518
like showing conferences[br]the user created.

0:00:13.518,0:00:14.810
Let's do that next.
