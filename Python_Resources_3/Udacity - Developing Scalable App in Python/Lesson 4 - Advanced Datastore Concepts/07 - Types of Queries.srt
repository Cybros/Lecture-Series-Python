0:00:00.950,0:00:03.190
Okay. So now we turn to a big topic

0:00:03.190,0:00:06.380
when you use Datastore, queries. And we will start

0:00:06.380,0:00:08.570
by giving you an overview of the types of

0:00:08.570,0:00:12.150
queries that we will run. Let's do that by looking

0:00:12.150,0:00:14.600
at Conference Central, where we will build out the

0:00:14.600,0:00:18.570
show conferences function. In the first tab here, we

0:00:18.570,0:00:22.580
can see all the conferences. This query is called

0:00:22.580,0:00:26.020
query by kind, because we will search for all entities

0:00:26.020,0:00:28.580
that are of the conference kind. In the

0:00:28.580,0:00:30.930
second tab, we can see all the conferences

0:00:30.930,0:00:34.560
created by the user. This query is called

0:00:34.560,0:00:38.160
query by kind, filter by ancestor, because we will

0:00:38.160,0:00:41.100
search for all conferences that have the user

0:00:41.100,0:00:44.620
as their ancestor. Remember, this is the ancestor

0:00:44.620,0:00:47.560
relationship we established between the conference, and the

0:00:47.560,0:00:51.190
profile that created the conference. And finally, in the

0:00:51.190,0:00:53.610
third tab we will see all conferences the

0:00:53.610,0:00:56.930
user has registered to attend. This query is

0:00:56.930,0:01:00.520
called query by kind filter by property, because

0:01:00.520,0:01:03.000
we will display all conferences that are in the

0:01:03.000,0:01:07.590
attended conference property of the profile entity. Remember,

0:01:07.590,0:01:10.140
this is to has a relationship we created

0:01:10.140,0:01:12.810
between a profile and the conferences they registered

0:01:12.810,0:01:16.170
to attend. And one more thing. In this part,

0:01:16.170,0:01:18.150
you can further restrict the search result by

0:01:18.150,0:01:21.260
applying filters. And as you can see from the

0:01:21.260,0:01:23.600
drop down menu, these are properties in the

0:01:23.600,0:01:26.950
conference kind. So therefore, these will also be a

0:01:26.950,0:01:31.780
query by kind, filtered by property. Okay. So

0:01:31.780,0:01:33.490
these are the query types we will look at

0:01:33.490,0:01:36.840
now. Query by kind, query by kind filtered by

0:01:36.840,0:01:41.360
ancestor, query by kind filtered by property. The query

0:01:41.360,0:01:46.510
by kind filtered by property, is a little bit advanced stuff. The other ones

0:01:46.510,0:01:48.230
are pretty straight forward though, so you'll

0:01:48.230,0:01:50.410
start off by adding them to Conference Central.
