This is a sandwich. It's not a regular

0:00:03.900,0:00:06.050
sandwich. It's a little bit bigger than the

0:00:06.050,0:00:10.210
regular sandwich, but it looks delicious. So why

0:00:10.210,0:00:13.150
am I telling you this? Well, datastore is like

0:00:13.150,0:00:16.610
a sandwich. It has layers, each layer built

0:00:16.610,0:00:20.250
on top of the other for support. We have

0:00:20.250,0:00:23.690
covered a lot of layers in lesson four

0:00:23.690,0:00:26.080
and we only have two more layers to cover.

0:00:26.080,0:00:30.270
So, keep the good work up. As for me, I'm eating a sandwich.
