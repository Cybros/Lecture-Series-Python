The answer is, purchase tickets. The reason for

0:00:03.310,0:00:05.939
this, is that when you purchase tickets, you probably

0:00:05.939,0:00:08.580
want to immediately see the confirmation that you are

0:00:08.580,0:00:11.720
registered. To guarantee this, we need to have strong

0:00:11.720,0:00:14.200
consistency. And in order to have the term strong

0:00:14.200,0:00:18.017
consistency, we need to establish an ancestor relationship. The

0:00:18.017,0:00:22.150
other two, add social components and conference venus. Are

0:00:22.150,0:00:24.860
probably not so sensitive to be up to date.

0:00:24.860,0:00:28.110
So there may not be, any need for strong consistency.

0:00:28.110,0:00:31.480
So eventual consistency is probably a better choice for those.
