1. difference is between print statemnt.
in python 2 we can print output by writing just print 'argument' but python 3 doesnot support it.
in python 3 we have to print output by syntax print(argument).

2. another differnce is in some operators.
print 7/5                     #in python 2 output is 1
print 7/5                     #in python 3 output is 1.4
