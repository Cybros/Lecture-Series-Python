# List of Ideas for Python Scripts

### 1. A script that saves your desktop so that I can restore it at a later time
### 2.  Python unittest frameworks
The idea is to create [scripts](unittests) that uses the last unittest python frameworks showing examples of each one and will be easy to understand the difference. The scripts could be:
* Usage of [Unittest](unittests/test_my_code.py) and examples
* Usage of [Nose & Nose2](unittests/test_nose.py) and examples
* Usage of Pytest and examples
* Usage of Green and examples
